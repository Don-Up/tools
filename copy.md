The correct answer is:

**2. False.**

In TypeScript, if the type cannot be determined and you don't explicitly provide a type, **TypeScript does not automatically assign the `any` type**. Instead, it assigns the `unknown` type, which is safer than `any`. The `unknown` type is a type-safe counterpart to `any`â€”you cannot perform any operations on a variable of type `unknown` without first narrowing its type.

However, TypeScript will assign the `any` type only if **the `noImplicitAny`** setting is disabled in the TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.json`). With `noImplicitAny` enabled, TypeScript will give an error when it cannot infer the type, rather than automatically assigning `any`.

### Example:

```typescript
let x;  // TypeScript infers the type as `any` if `noImplicitAny` is not enabled.
x = 42; // No error (unless `noImplicitAny` is enabled)
```

If `noImplicitAny` is enabled in `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "noImplicitAny": true
  }
}
```

The above code would cause a TypeScript error:

```
Variable 'x' implicitly has an 'any' type because it does not have a type annotation and 'noImplicitAny' is enabled.
```

### Example with `unknown`:

```typescript
let y: unknown;  // `unknown` type, not `any`
y = 42;

if (typeof y === 'number') {
  console.log(y * 2);  // Now we can safely work with `y` as a number
}
```

In this example, `unknown` forces you to narrow the type before performing operations on it.
