# 赖盖特之谜
### 1
In the spring of 1887, my friend Holmes fell ill from overwork and was still recovering.

> 1887年春，我朋友福尔摩斯劳累过度病倒，身体仍在康复中。

The cases of the Netherland-Sumatra Company and Baron Maupertuis, which he had handled, were significant and still fresh in people’s memories.

> 他经手的荷兰-苏门答腊公司案、莫佩尔蒂男爵案都是重大案件，留给世人的记忆还很新鲜。

Due to their close ties to politics and economics, they were unsuitable for inclusion in this collection of stories.

> 因为和政治、经济关系太过密切，不适合收录在这个故事集中。

However, they indirectly led to another complex and peculiar case, giving my friend the opportunity to demonstrate the value of a new “weapon.”

> 不过，它们间接引出了另一个复杂的奇案，让我朋友有机会展现新“武器”的价值。

He possessed countless “weapons” and spent his life battling crime.

> 他拥有“武器”无数，一生都在同罪案战斗。

Reviewing my notes from that time, on April 14, a telegram arrived from Lyon informing me that Holmes had fallen ill and was staying at the Hotel Dulong.

> 我查看当时的记录，4月14日，里昂发来电报，通知我说福尔摩斯病倒，住在杜朗旅馆。

Within a day, I arrived at his sickroom and was relieved to find his condition not severe.

> 不出一天，我赶到他病房，看他症状不严重，总算松了口气。

Two long months of case investigations had worn down even his iron constitution.

> 漫漫两个月的案件调查，像他这样的钢铁体格也累垮了。

He worked at least fifteen hours a day, and he once told me that there were several occasions when he worked nonstop for five days.

> 每天至少工作十五小时，他还告诉我，有好几次没日没夜工作了五天。

The fruits of his labor could not counteract the aftereffects of such overexertion.

> 劳动的胜利果实并不能抑制过度消耗带来的后遗症。

During that time, his name spread across Europe, and his room was filled with congratulatory telegrams piled ankle-high, yet he himself sank into the darkest depression.

> 那段时间，他的名字传遍欧洲，房间地上堆满了贺电，说齐踝高都不夸张，而他本人却陷入了最阴暗的抑郁中。

He had single-handedly solved cases that baffled the police of three nations and completely defeated Europe’s most cunning fraudster, yet even such achievements could not lift his weakened spirits.

> 三国警方无法侦破的案子，他一人就解决了，彻底打败了欧洲最狡猾的诈骗犯，即使这样的战绩也不能振奋他衰弱的神经。

Three days later, we returned to Baker Street.

> 三天后，我们回到贝克街。

The apartment was not an ideal place for recuperation, and Holmes needed a change of environment.

> 公寓不是休养身心的好地方，福尔摩斯需要换个环境。

The idea of spending a week in the countryside during the beautiful spring weather was also appealing to me.

> 趁着大好春光，去乡间待上一周，这个想法对我也充满吸引力。

I remembered my old friend Colonel Hayter, whom I had treated in Afghanistan.

> 我想起老朋友海特上校，在阿富汗时我给他看过病。

He had bought a house near Reigate in Surrey and had invited me several times, the last time specifically mentioning that I should bring Holmes along, promising a warm welcome.

> 他在萨里郡的赖盖特镇附近买了房，多次邀请我去玩，最后一次还特意说让我带上福尔摩斯，他一定盛情款待。

After much persuasion, Holmes, upon learning that our host was a bachelor with no women in the house and that we would have complete freedom, finally agreed to the arrangement.

> 我磨了半天嘴皮，福尔摩斯得知主人单身，家里没女人，可以自由活动，最终答应了我的安排。

A week after returning from Lyon, we settled into the Colonel’s home.

> 从里昂回来一周后，我们住进了上校家。

Hayter was an excellent veteran, well-traveled and knowledgeable, and as I expected, he quickly found much common ground with Holmes.

> 海特是个出色的老兵，见多识广，不出我所料，他很快和福尔摩斯找到了许多共同话题。

On the evening of our arrival, after dinner, we went to the Colonel’s gun room, where Holmes lounged on a sofa while Hayter showed me his collection of Eastern weapons.

> 到的那天晚上，吃过饭，我们来到上校的枪械室，福尔摩斯舒展地躺在沙发上，海特带我看他收藏的东方武器。

“By the way,” he suddenly said, “I’ll take a gun upstairs later, just in case of an emergency.”

> “对了，”他突然说，“待会我要带把枪上去，以防紧急情况。”

“An emergency?” I asked.

> “紧急情况？”我说。

“Yes, there’s been some trouble around here lately, and everyone’s on edge. Last Monday, old Acton’s house was burgled. He’s one of the wealthiest men in the county. The loss wasn’t great, but the thief hasn’t been caught yet.”

> “是啊，这一带最近出了事，大家吓得不轻。上周一，老阿克顿家被盗。他是郡里数一数二的富豪。损失倒不大，可到现在还没抓住盗贼。”

“No clues?” Holmes asked, glancing sideways at the Colonel.

> “没线索？”福尔摩斯斜眼看着上校问。

“None at all. Mr. Holmes, you’ve handled international cases, so a trivial rural burglary like this must be beneath your notice.”

> “完全没有。福尔摩斯先生，你是办过国际大案的人，这样微不足道的乡村小案，肯定不放在眼里。”

Holmes waved off the compliment with a smile, clearly pleased.

> 福尔摩斯摆摆手回应赞美，脸上浮现出微笑，看来心里很高兴。

“Anything noteworthy?”

> “有没有值得注意的地方？”

“Not really. The study was ransacked, drawers forced open, books thrown into chaos. The thief went to great effort but gained little. Missing items include Pope’s translation of the *Iliad*—oddly, only one volume of the set was taken—two gilt candlesticks, an ivory paperweight, a small oak barometer, and a ball of twine.”

> “恐怕没有。被盗的是书房，整个地方翻了个底朝天，抽屉全撬开了，书都乱得不成样子。盗贼费了那么大功夫，收获却很少。不见的东西包括蒲柏翻译的《荷马史诗》，奇怪的是整套书只丢了一卷，还有两个镀金烛台、一个象牙镇纸、一个袖珍橡木气压计、一团麻线。”

“What an unusual combination!” I exclaimed.

> “真是不寻常的组合！”我感叹。

“Well, these fellows clearly took whatever they saw,” said the Colonel.

> “嗯，这些家伙显然是看到什么拿什么。”上校说。

Holmes grunted and said, “The local police should see some clues in this. It’s obvious…”

> 福尔摩斯哼了一声，说：“郡里的警察应该从中看出点儿线索，明摆着是……”

I raised a finger to interrupt him, reminding him, “My dear fellow, you’re here to rest. Your nerves aren’t fully recovered yet. Don’t touch a new case.”

> 我举起一根手指打断他，提醒道：“老兄，你是来休息的。精神还没恢复好，千万别碰新案子。”

Holmes shrugged, glancing helplessly at the Colonel with a hint of amusement in his eyes.

> 福尔摩斯耸耸肩，无奈地瞥了眼上校，眼带笑意。

We then turned to lighter topics.

> 我们转而聊起了轻松的话题。

However, my professional advice was destined to be in vain.

> 不过，我的专业建议注定都是白费。

The next morning, the case intruded into our world again, making it impossible to ignore.

> 第二天一早，案子再次闯进我们的世界，不可能置之不理。

Our rural retreat had taken an unexpected turn, completely unplanned.

> 乡村休闲之行发生了改变，完全不在计划之内。

We were having breakfast when the Colonel’s butler rushed in, breathless and disregarding decorum, exclaiming, “Sir, have you heard? The Cunninghams, sir!”

> 我们正吃早饭，上校的管家冲进来，顾不上礼节，气喘吁吁地喊：“先生，听说了吗？坎宁安家，先生！”

“Burgled again?” the Colonel exclaimed, his coffee cup suspended in mid-air.

> “也被盗了？”上校大声说，咖啡杯举在半空。

“Murdered!” the Colonel cried out, “Good heavens! Who’s dead? The magistrate or his son?”

> “杀了人！”上校惊叫一声：“天啊！谁死了？治安法官还是他儿子？”

“Neither, sir. It’s the coachman, William. Shot through the heart, dead on the spot.”

> “都不是，先生，是马夫威廉。一枪打中心脏，当场送命。”

### 2
"Who killed him?"

> “谁杀的？”

"The thief, sir. He broke in through the kitchen window and happened to run into William. The groom lost his life while trying to protect his master's property. The thief escaped quickly, disappearing without a trace."

> “盗贼，先生。他从厨房窗子闯进去，正巧撞上威廉。为了保护主人的财物，马夫丢了性命。盗贼飞快地逃了，逃得无影无踪。”

"When did it happen?"

> “什么时候的事？”

"Last night, sir, around twelve."

> “昨晚，先生，十二点左右。”

"Ah, let's go take a look later."

> “唉，我们待会儿去看看。”

The colonel regained his composure and continued his breakfast. The butler left, and he added:

> 上校恢复镇定，接着吃早饭。管家出去了，他接着说：

"Old Cunningham is a prominent figure around here, and he's particularly upright. The groom has served him for many years, devotedly, and he must be heartbroken."

> “老坎宁安是这一带有头有脸的人物，为人也特别正派。马夫在他家服务多年，忠心耿耿，他肯定伤心得要命。”

"The murderer is clearly the burglar who broke into the Acton house."

> “杀人犯显然就是闯进阿克顿家的盗贼。”

"That guy who stole a bunch of odd things?"

> “那个偷走一堆怪东西的家伙？”

Holmes said thoughtfully.

> 福尔摩斯若有所思地说。

"That's right."

> “没错。”

"Well! It might be the simplest case in the world, but at first glance, it still seems a bit strange, doesn't it? It's safer to rob in rural areas by changing locations rather than breaking into two houses in the same area within a few days. You mentioned taking precautions last night, and it suddenly occurred to me that this parish might be the least attractive place for thieves in the country. There are still many doubts to clarify."

> “嗯！可能是世上最简单的案子，但一眼看上去，还是有点儿奇怪，不是吗？在乡村地带行盗，变换作案地点才安全，不会时隔几天闯入同一地区的两户人家。你昨晚说采取预防措施，我突然想到，这个教区应该是全国最不吸引盗贼的地方。还是有很多疑点有待查明。”

"Perhaps it's a local thief," the colonel said, "if so, Acton and Cunningham are indeed the best targets, as they are the richest families here."

> “也许是本地盗贼干的，”上校说，“果真如此，阿克顿和坎宁安正是最佳目标，他们是本地最大的人家。”

"And the richest?"

> “也是最富的？”

"Originally, yes. The two families have been in litigation for several years, consuming a lot of wealth. Old Acton claims that half of Cunningham's estate belongs to him, and the lawyers have been busy with this case."

> “本来是，两家打了好几年官司，都消耗了不少钱财。老阿克顿称坎宁安家一半的地产都属于他，律师们为了这个官司忙得够呛。”

"It is indeed a local job, and it won't be hard to investigate."

> “真是本地人干的，追查起来并不难。”

Holmes yawned.

> 福尔摩斯打了个哈欠。

"Alright, Watson, I don't plan to get involved."

> “好了，华生，我不打算插手。”

The butler pushed open the door and announced:

> 管家推开门，通报道：

"Sir, Detective Wilfrid has arrived."

> “先生，福利斯特警探来了。”

A young officer entered, looking very alert.

> 一个年轻警官进来，模样十分机警。

"Good morning, Colonel," he said, "I hope I’m not disturbing you. The police heard that Mr. Sherlock Holmes is here."

> “早上好，上校，”他说，“希望没打扰到你们。警方听说贝克街的福尔摩斯先生在这儿。”

The colonel waved his hand towards my friend, and the detective quickly bowed, saying:

> 上校挥手指向我朋友，警探连忙鞠了个躬，说：

"Mr. Holmes, we sincerely invite you to assist in the investigation."

> “福尔摩斯先生，诚邀您帮忙查案。”

"Fate is playing tricks on you, Watson," Holmes laughed.

> “命运偏偏跟你作对，华生，”福尔摩斯笑道。

"Detective, we were just discussing this case when you came in; perhaps you can share some details."

> “警探先生，你进来时我们正在聊这个案子，也许你能透露一点儿细节。”

He leaned back in his chair, a familiar expression telling me that solving the case was not a problem.

> 他往椅背上一靠，熟悉的神情告诉我，破案不成问题。

"The Acton case has no leads yet, but this recent one has quite a few. We can confirm that the perpetrators of both cases are the same; someone has seen him."

> “阿克顿的案子还没线索，刚发生的这件倒有不少。我们能确定，两个案子的作案人相同，有人看见他了。”

"Huh?"

> “啊？”

"Yes, sir. He shot the unfortunate William Cowan and fled the scene quickly. Old Cunningham saw him from the bedroom window, and his son, Alec Cunningham, also saw him from the hallway at the back of the house. The incident occurred at eleven forty-five; old Cunningham had just gone to bed, and Alec was in his robe smoking. Both heard the groom, William, calling for help. Alec immediately ran downstairs, found the back door open, and saw two men struggling outside, one of whom shot the other down. The murderer crossed the garden and jumped over the hedge. Old Cunningham looked out the bedroom window and saw the murderer run onto the main road, disappearing quickly. Alec was focused on helping and didn’t pursue; the murderer vanished without a trace. As for his appearance, we only know he was of medium build and wearing dark clothing. We are investigating with all our might; if he is an outsider, it won't take long to find him."

> “是的，先生。他开枪打死了不幸的威廉·柯万，飞快逃离现场。老坎宁安从卧室窗户看见了他，儿子亚历克·坎宁安在靠房子后面的过道也看见了。案发时是十一点四十五分，老坎宁安刚上床，亚历克穿着睡袍在抽烟。两人都听到马夫威廉呼救，亚历克立刻往楼下跑，发现后门敞开，下到楼梯口，看见外面有两人扭打在一起，其中一个开枪，另一个倒下。凶手穿过花园，跳过树篱跑了。老坎宁安从卧室窗户往外看，凶手跑上大路，很快消失了。亚历克顾着救人，没追上去，凶手逃得无影无踪。至于外貌特征，只知道中等身材、穿深色衣服。我们正全力调查，如果是外来人，用不了多久就能查出来。”

"How could William be there? Did he say anything before he died?"

> “威廉怎么会在那儿？死前说了什么吗？”

"Not a word. He lived in the small house at the entrance with his mother; he was a very responsible servant, and the police believe he went to check if everything was alright inside. After the Acton house was robbed, everyone became more vigilant. The thief pried open the door and happened to run into William."

> “一个字没说。他和母亲住在门口小屋，是个非常负责的用人，警方认为他是去检查屋里是否一切正常。阿克顿家被盗后，每个人都提高了警惕。盗贼撬开门，正好撞上威廉。”

"What did William say to his mother before he left?"

> “威廉出门前跟母亲说了什么？”

"She is old and deaf, and couldn’t ask anything. The case hit her hard; she seems a bit dazed, though she was already somewhat slow to react. There’s one very important clue; look at this!"

> “她又老又聋，什么也问不出来。案子对她打击很大，有些痴呆了，不过她原来反应就有点迟钝。还有一个非常重要的线索，看这个！”

He took out a small piece of torn note paper, spread it on his lap, and continued:

> 他掏出一小片撕碎的笔记纸，在腿上摊开，接着说：

"This was found between the index and thumb of the deceased, as if it had been torn from a larger sheet. The time written on it matches the time of the incident. Either the murderer tore off another part from his hand, or he pulled this piece from the murderer's hand."

> “这是在死者食指和大拇指间发现的，像是从一张更大的纸上拽下来的，上面写的时间跟案发时间吻合。要么是凶手从他手上扯走了另一部分，要么是他从凶手手上拽了这一部。”

Sure! Here’s the translated and organized bilingual text:

---
"If it was a rendezvous," the detective continued, "William Cowan was likely the thief's accomplice, despite his reputation for loyalty. They met there, he helped the thief into the house, and then a dispute occurred."

> “假如是约会，”警探继续说，“这个威廉·柯万很可能是盗贼的同谋，尽管他一向拥有忠诚的美名。他们在那儿碰头，他帮盗贼进屋，随后两人发生了争执。”

Holmes focused on examining the note and said: "The handwriting is quite interesting; this case is much more complicated than I imagined."

> 福尔摩斯专注地检查字条，说：“笔迹相当有意思，案子比我想象的复杂得多。”

He then buried his head in his hands.

> 说完把头埋入双手中。

The detective smiled with satisfaction, pleased that the famous London sleuth was engaged in thought over the case he brought.

> 警探满意地笑了，他带来的案子竟让著名的伦敦神探动起了脑筋。

After a while, Holmes said: "You mentioned a possibility that the thief conspired with the groom, and the note was an arrangement for a meeting. This hypothesis is quite special; it's not impossible. But these handwriting..."

> 过了一会儿，福尔摩斯说：“你最后说到一种可能，盗贼和马夫共谋，字条是其中一个约另一个见面。这种假设很特别，不是不可能。但是这些笔迹……”

He buried his head in his hands again, lost in thought.

> 他又把头埋进双手，陷入了沉思。

A few minutes later, he raised his head, and to my surprise, I found him glowing with excitement, his eyes sparkling, full of energy like when he was healthy, and he jumped up vibrantly.

> 几分钟后，他抬起头，我惊讶地发现，他满面红光，眼睛闪烁着光芒，跟没病时的状态一样，充满活力地跳起身。

"Alright," he said, "I want to understand the details of the case first; some aspects are indeed fascinating. Colonel, forgive my rudeness, but I must leave you and Watson for now. I’ll go with the detective to verify a couple of small hypotheses and return in half an hour."

> “好了，”他说，“我想先去了解一下案子的细节，有些地方确实让人着迷。上校，恕我失礼，暂时撇下你和华生。我跟警探去一趟，验证一两个小小的推测，半小时后回来。”

An hour and a half passed, and the detective returned alone.

> 一个半小时过去，警探一个人回来了。

"Mr. Holmes is wandering in the fields outside," the detective said, "and he hopes the three of us will go with him to the house."

> “福尔摩斯先生在外面的田野转悠，”警探说，“他希望我们三个跟他一起去房子那儿。”

"Cunningham's house?"

> “坎宁安先生家？”

"Yes, sir."

> “是的，先生。”

"What for?"

> “去干什么？”

The detective shrugged and said: "I don’t know, sir. To be frank, I think Mr. Holmes is still unwell; his behavior is very strange, and he seems a bit overly excited."

> 警探耸耸肩，说：“不知道，先生。坦白说，我觉得福尔摩斯先生的病还没好，行为非常古怪，情绪也有点儿激动过头。”

"Don't be nervous," I said, "in my experience, what seems like madness is often investigation."

> “不必紧张，”我说，“我的经验是，看似发疯，实则探案。”

"Perhaps some feel that what seems like investigation is actually madness," the detective muttered, "Colonel, he is eager for us to go; let’s get ready and go."

> “也许有人的感觉是，看似探案，实则发疯，”警探嘟囔道，“上校，他急着要我们过去，准备好了就走吧。”

We saw Holmes pacing back and forth in the field, his head down and hands in his pockets.

> 我们看见福尔摩斯在田野来回走动，脑袋低垂，双手插在裤子口袋里。

"This case is getting more interesting," he said, "Watson, your arranged country trip was very successful. I’ve had a wonderful morning."

> “案子越来越有趣了，”他说，“华生，你安排的乡村之行非常成功。我度过了一个美好的早晨。”

"I assume you've been to the crime scene."

> “想必去过案发现场了。”

"Yes, I investigated with the detective."

> “是的，我和警探一起调查了一番。”

"Any findings?"

> “有收获吗？”

"Well, I saw some interesting things; let me tell you as we walk. First, we saw the unfortunate victim's body; he indeed died from gunshot wounds, just as the police confirmed."

> “嗯，看到了一些有意思的东西，边走边说。首先，我们看到了不幸遇害者的尸体，确实是中枪身亡，跟警方查证的一样。”

"So, you had suspicions before?"

> “这么说，你之前有怀疑？”

"Ah, every detail needs verification; the investigation is not in vain. Next, we asked old Cunningham and his son a few questions. They pointed out the specific location where the murderer jumped over the garden hedge to escape, which was very useful."

> “啊，每个细节都需要验证一下，调查并不是白费。接着，我们问了老坎宁安和他儿子几个问题。他们指出凶手跳过花园树篱逃跑的具体位置，很有用。”

"Of course."

> “那是当然。”

"Then we went to see the unfortunate victim's mother. She is old and frail and couldn’t provide any information."

> “然后，我们去看了不幸遇害者的母亲。她年老体弱，无法提供任何信息。”

"What are the results of the investigation?"

> “调查结果如何？”

"We've confirmed this is a strange case; perhaps this trip can clarify things further. Detective, I agree with you that the fragment of paper in the deceased's hand is very important, as it indicates the time of his murder."

> “确定这是一件奇案，也许这一趟能让案情更明朗。警探先生，我和你意见一致，死者手中的碎纸片非常重要，上面写的正是他遇害的时间。”

"This should provide clues, Mr. Holmes."

> “应该能提供线索，福尔摩斯先生。”

"It indeed provided clues. Regardless of who wrote the note, it instructed William to get up and go inside at that time. The question is, where is the other half of the paper?"

> “确实提供了线索。不管谁写的字条，是他让威廉在那个时间起床进屋。问题是，另一半纸在哪儿？”

"I carefully examined the ground and found nothing," the detective said.

> “我仔细检查过地面，没找到。”警探说。

"The note was torn from the deceased's hand. Why would someone want it so badly? Because it is evidence. Once the note was obtained, what then? It was likely stuffed into a pocket without noticing that the deceased still held onto a corner. If we find the other half of the paper, it will surely help solve the mystery."

> “字条是从死者手中扯走的。为什么有人这么想得到它？因为它是罪证。字条到手了，然后呢？很可能塞进了口袋，没留意到死者手里还抓着一角。只要找到另一半纸，肯定对破解谜团大有帮助。”

"That’s true, but we still haven’t seen the criminal; how do we search the criminal's pockets?"

> “话是没错，可是连罪犯都还没影呢，怎么搜查罪犯的口袋？”

"Yes, that’s worth considering. There's also another obvious clue; the note was addressed to William. The writer of the letter could not be the messenger; otherwise, they could have simply told William in person. So who is the messenger? Or was it sent via the post office?"

> “是啊，值得好好考虑。另外还有一条明显的线索，字条是寄给威廉的。写信人不可能是送信人，不然的话，亲口告诉威廉不就得了。那么，送信人是谁？或者，是通过邮局寄的？”

"I checked," the detective said, "the post office sent a letter to William yesterday afternoon, and he destroyed the envelope."

> “我查过了，”警探说，“邮局昨天下午给威廉发过一封信，信封被他销毁了。”

Sure! Here’s the translated and organized bilingual text:

---
"Wonderful!" Holmes patted the detective on the back, "It seems you’ve asked the postman. It’s a pleasure working with you. Here we are; this is the groom's cottage. Colonel, please follow me to see the crime scene."

> “太好了！”福尔摩斯拍拍警探的背，“看来你问过邮差了。跟你合作很愉快。到了，这是马夫的小屋。上校，请跟我来，去看看案发现场。”

We passed a beautiful cottage, where the deceased lived before. At the end of the oak tree-lined path stood an old house, built in the time of Queen Anne, with the year of the Battle of Malplaquet carved above the door.

> 我们路过一座漂亮的小屋，是死者生前住的地方。沿着橡树林荫道走到头，眼前是座古朴的房子，建于安妮女王时期，门楣上刻着马尔普拉凯战役的年份。

Holmes and the detective led us around to the side door, where the garden was separated from the road by a row of hedges. A policeman stood at the kitchen door.

> 福尔摩斯和警探带我们绕到边门，门口是花园，一排树篱隔开了花园和大路。厨房门口站着一个警察。

"Please open the door, officer," Holmes said, "Look, young Cunningham is over there at the top of the stairs. He saw two people struggling from where we are standing now. Old Cunningham saw the murderer escape from the left side of the hedge at the second window from the left. His son also saw it, and both are certain about the position of the hedge. Later, young Cunningham ran out and knelt beside the victim. Look, the ground is too hard; there are no marks left."

> “请开门，警官，”福尔摩斯说，“看，小坎宁安在那边的楼梯口，看见我们现在站的地方有两个人扭打在一起。老坎宁安在左数第二扇窗前，看见凶手从树篱左边逃走。他儿子也看见了，父子俩都很确定树篱的位置。后来，小坎宁安跑出来，跪在伤者旁边。看，地面太硬，没留下任何印记。”

Just then, two men rounded the corner of the house, walking up the garden path. One was older, with a stern face, deeply lined wrinkles, and a melancholic gaze; the other was young, fashionably dressed, with a sunny smile and bright clothes that starkly contrasted with the case we were investigating.

> 正说着，两个男人绕过屋角，走上花园小路。一个年纪大，面容坚毅，刻满深深的皱纹，眼神忧郁；另一个年轻，打扮时尚，阳光的笑容、鲜艳的衣服跟我们正在调查的命案形成了鲜明的对比。

"Still investigating?" the young man said to Holmes, "You Londoners never make mistakes, but your efficiency seems quite low."

> “还在查？”年轻人对福尔摩斯说，“你们伦敦人做事从不出错，可是效率似乎不太高。”

"Ah, you need to give us enough time," Holmes replied calmly.

> “啊，你得给我们足够的时间。”福尔摩斯从容地说。

"We have plenty of time," young Cunningham said, "But I don’t see any clues here."

> “有的是时间，”小坎宁安说，“不过，我没看出我们这儿有什么线索。”

"There is one," the detective said, "as long as we can find it... Good heavens, Mr. Holmes! What’s wrong with you?"

> “有一条，”警探说，“只要能找到……天啊，福尔摩斯先生！你怎么了？”

My poor friend suddenly displayed a horrifying expression, his features twisted in pain, his eyes rolling back, and he couldn’t help but let out a groan before collapsing to the ground.

> 我那可怜的朋友突然露出可怕的表情，五官痛苦地扭曲，白眼直翻，忍不住发出一声呻吟，一头栽倒在地。

His condition deteriorated so suddenly and severely that we were terrified and quickly carried him into the kitchen.

> 病情突发，又这么严重，我们吓坏了，赶紧把他抬进厨房。

He lay in a large chair, breathing heavily. After a few minutes, he was finally able to sit up, apologizing for his weakness.

> 他躺在大椅子上，不停喘粗气，过了几分钟，终于能坐起来，不好意思地为自己的虚弱道歉。

"I had a severe illness," he explained, "I just recovered; Watson knows it’s easy for neuralgia to flare up."

> “我生了场重病，”他解释道，“刚刚恢复，华生知道的，很容易突发神经痛。”

"Shall I send a carriage to take you back?" old Cunningham asked.

> “派车送你回去吧？”老坎宁安问。

"Since I’m here, there is one thing I want to clarify, and it shouldn’t be difficult."

> “既然来了，有一点我想查清，查起来也不难。”

"What is it?"

> “什么？”

"I suspect that the unfortunate William entered the house after the thief, rather than before. You assumed that the thief merely pried open the door without entering."

> “我认为有一种可能，这个不幸的威廉比盗贼后进屋，而不是先进屋。你们想当然以为，盗贼只是撬开了门，没进屋。”

"Isn’t it obvious?" old Cunningham said seriously. "My son Alec was still awake; if the thief had entered, he would have definitely heard the noise."

> “难道不明显吗？”老坎宁安严肃地说，“我儿子亚历克还没睡，盗贼要是进屋了，他肯定能听到动静。”

"Where was he at the time?"

> “他当时在哪儿？”

"I was smoking in the dressing room," young Cunningham replied.

> “我在更衣室抽烟。”小坎宁安回答。

"Which window?"

> “是哪扇窗户？”

"The last one on the left, next to my father's bedroom window."

> “左边最后一个，挨着父亲卧室那扇。”

"So both rooms had their lights on?"

> “这么说，两个房间都亮着灯？”

"Yes."

> “对。”

"That’s strange," Holmes said with a smile, "From the lit rooms, it is clear that there were two people still awake in the house. Yet the thief, an experienced one at that, chose to target this house; isn’t that unusual?"

> “这就奇怪了，”福尔摩斯笑着说，“从亮灯的房间能看出，家里有两个人还没睡，盗贼，而且是个有经验的盗贼，却偏要找这家下手，是不是不正常？”

"He’s bold."

> “他胆子大。”

"Exactly because it’s unusual that I was asked to help," young Cunningham said, "You just said that the thief had already entered the house to steal before colliding with William. This idea is rather absurd. If it were as you said, why was the house not in disarray? Why were things not missing?"

> “正因为不正常，才会请你来帮忙，”小坎宁安说，“你刚才说，盗贼撞上威廉之前，已经进屋行窃。这种想法未免太可笑。真要像你说的那样，屋子为什么没乱？东西为什么没丢？”

"That depends on what he stole," Holmes replied, "Don’t forget, we are dealing with an unusual thief who has his own methods. Think about the odd things he stole from the Acton house; what were they? A ball of yarn, a paperweight, and some miscellaneous items—I can’t recall."

> “那要看他偷的什么东西，”福尔摩斯说，“别忘了，我们对付的是个与众不同的盗贼，自有他的一套手法。想想他从阿克顿家偷走的怪东西，都有些什么呢？线团、镇纸，还有些杂七杂八的东西，我想不起来了。”

"Alright, Mr. Holmes, I leave everything to you," old Cunningham said, "Whatever you and the detective need us to do, just say it."

> “行，福尔摩斯先生，一切交给你了，”老坎宁安说，“你和警探需要我们做什么，尽管说。”
