"I have already resigned and will escape his devilish enslavement within a week or two. He is heartless, cruel to those around him, and his public acts of charity are merely a façade to conceal his private sins.

> “我已经提出辞职，一两周内就会摆脱他的魔鬼奴役。他这人铁石心肠，对身边人冷酷无情，那些公共慈善活动不过是为了掩盖私底下的罪恶。

His wife was his greatest victim. He was utterly cruel to her—truly, sir, utterly cruel! I don’t know how she died, but I’m certain that her life with him was a fate worse than death.

> 他妻子是最大的受害者，他对她残忍至极，真的，先生，残忍至极！她是怎么丧命的我不清楚，但我确定她的人生因为他生不如死。

She was from the tropics, a Brazilian woman, as I suppose you already know."

> 她来自热带，是巴西人，想必你已经知道了。”

"No, I didn’t know that."

> “不，并不知道。”

"A tropical heritage, a tropical nature—a woman born under the sun and heat, full of passion. Her love for him was intense, as only a tropical woman’s love could be.

> “热带血统，热带天性，阳光和热情孕育下的女人。她对他的爱是热带女人特有的那种浓烈的爱，

I heard she was a great beauty in her youth, but as her beauty faded, she could no longer hold his attention.

> 我听说她年轻时是个大美人，可是美貌渐渐褪去，再也吸引不了他。

We all liked her and sympathized with her. We hated seeing the way he treated her.

> 我们都很喜欢她、同情她，看他那样对待她，都痛恨不已。

He is cunning and always finds a way to justify himself with clever words.

> 他很狡猾，总能凭花言巧语为自己辩护。

That’s all I have to say—don’t just look at the surface; there’s more behind the scenes. Well, I must go now. No, no, don’t stop me! He’s almost here."

> 我要说的就这些，千万不要只看表面，背后还藏着一套呢。好了，我该走了，不，不，别留我！他快来了。”

The strange guest glanced at the clock in panic and dashed out of the door as if fleeing for his life.

> 奇怪的客人慌慌张张看了眼钟，真的是飞跑着冲出了房门。

Holmes was silent for a moment before saying:

> 福尔摩斯沉默了儿，开口说道：

"Tsk, tsk! The loyalty of Mr. Gibson’s household is truly touching. Still, his warning was somewhat useful. Now, we wait for the man himself to arrive."

> “啧啧！吉布森先生的家里人真够忠心耿耿的。不过他的警告多少有点儿用，现在就等本尊驾临了。”

At exactly eleven o’clock, heavy footsteps echoed on the stairs, and the famous millionaire was ushered into the room.

> 十一点整，楼梯传来沉重的脚步声，赫赫有名的大富翁被带进了房间。

I looked at him and immediately understood the butler’s fear and loathing, as well as why so many of his business rivals cursed him.

> 我看着这个人，立刻理解了管家的恐惧和厌恶，也明白了为什么那么多生意对手都对他狠下诅咒。

If I were a sculptor aiming to depict the image of a hard, rigid, and successful businessman, I would choose Mr. Neil Gibson as my model.

> 假如我是雕塑家，想要塑造强硬、刻板的成功商人形象，应该会选尼尔·吉布森先生当模特。

He was tall and gaunt, his emaciated frame exuding greed and desire.

> 他瘦高个儿，干瘪的身子透着贪婪和欲望。

If Abraham Lincoln had not risen to greatness but instead taken up a lowly profession, he might have looked somewhat like this man.

> 如果亚伯拉罕·林肯不是身居高位，而是从事卑微的行当，大概会跟他的模样有几分相似。

His face, like something carved out of granite, was rigid, cold, and sharply contoured, with deep lines marking the crises he had weathered.

> 他的脸像是花岗岩雕刻而成，僵硬，冷酷，轮廓分明，一道道深陷的皱纹是一场场危机留下的印记。

Beneath his thick brows, his icy gray eyes darted back and forth between us.

> 浓密的眉毛下，两只冰冷的灰眼睛滴溜溜地在我们身上来回打转。

Holmes introduced me, and he gave a perfunctory nod before arrogantly pulling a chair close to Holmes, sitting down with his prominent knee bone nearly brushing against my friend.

> 福尔摩斯介绍了我，他敷衍地欠了欠身，然后盛气凌人地把椅子拉到福尔摩斯身边坐下，突出的膝盖骨几乎紧挨着我朋友。

"I’ll get straight to the point, Mr. Holmes," he began.

> “我就直说吧，福尔摩斯先生，”他开口道，

"I don’t care about cost. If money can light the way to the truth, I’ll burn it like torches.

> “这案子我不怕花钱，只要能为你照亮通向真相的路，烧钱当火把也没问题。

This woman is innocent, and her name must be cleared. I’m entrusting you with the task. Just name your price!"

> 这个女人是无辜的，必须还她清白，任务就交给你了，开个价吧！”

"My fees are fixed and rarely altered," Holmes said coldly.

> “我收费有固定标准，从不轻易改变，”福尔摩斯冷淡地说，

"And sometimes, I don’t charge at all."

> “有时候还免费。”

"Oh, you don’t care about profit. What you care about is fame, right? Solve this case, and every newspaper in Britain and America will sing your praises.

> “哦，不在乎利，总在乎名吧。破了这个案子，英国、美国的各家报纸都会给你唱赞歌，

You’ll be the talk of two continents."

> 你将成为两大洲的热门话题。”

"Thank you, Mr. Gibson, but I have no need for songs of praise. You may find it surprising, but I enjoy working anonymously. What attracts me is the case itself.

> “谢谢，吉布森先生，我不需要什么赞歌。你也许会惊讶，我喜欢匿名探案，吸引我的是案子本身。

Now, let’s not waste any more time. Tell me about the case."

> 好了，别浪费时间了，说说案子吧。”

"The main facts are all in the newspapers. I have little to add. If there’s anything you’re unclear about, well, I’m here to answer your questions."

> “主要情况报纸上都有，我没什么可补充的。你要有任何不清楚的地方，这不，我就是来解答的。”

"Very well, I have only one question."

> “那好，我只有一个问题。”

"What is it?"

> “什么？”

"What exactly is your relationship with Miss Dunbar?"

> “你和邓巴小姐到底什么关系？”

The mining magnate was startled, half-rising from his chair before quickly regaining his composure.

> 金矿大亨猛一惊，从椅子上半欠起身子，没过多久又恢复了镇定。

"I suppose you have the right—and the duty—to ask that question, Mr. Holmes."

> “我想你有权利——也有责任——问这个问题，福尔摩斯先生。”

"I agree with your reasoning," Holmes said.

> “我同意你的想法。”福尔摩斯说。

"I can assure you that our relationship has always been that of employer and governess. We only meet and talk in the presence of the children."

> “我可以保证，我们之间永远只是雇主和家庭教师的关系，只有孩子们在场的时候，雇主才和这位年轻女士见面、说话。”

Holmes stood up and said, "I’m busy, Mr. Gibson, and I have neither the time nor the interest to entertain lies. Goodbye."

> 福尔摩斯站了起来，说：“我很忙，吉布森先生，没时间也没兴趣聊瞎话。再见。”

The guest also rose, his tall, lanky body towering over Holmes. Anger flashed beneath his thick brows, and a flush of blood surged to his sallow face.

> 客人也站了起来，高大松垮的身体高出福尔摩斯一大截，浓眉下迸射出愤怒的光芒，蜡黄的脸上涌起一股血色。

"What do you mean, Mr. Holmes? Are you refusing my case?"

> “你什么意思，福尔摩斯先生？拒绝我的案子？”

"I’m refusing you, Mr. Gibson. My meaning should be clear enough."

> “我拒绝的是你，吉布森先生，我的意思已经够明白了。”

"It’s clear, but why? Are you trying to raise your price? Are you afraid you can’t solve it? Or is it something else? I have the right to know the reason."

> “是很明白，可是为什么呀？想抬价？担心破不了案？还是别的什么？我有权知道明确的原因。”

"Very well, let’s assume you do have that right. I’ll give you a reason," Holmes said.

> “好，就当你有吧，我给你一个原因，”福尔摩斯说，

"This case is already complicated enough without false information adding to its difficulty."

> “这案子已经非常复杂了，不需要虚假信息来增加难度。”

"Are you saying I’m lying?"

> “你是说我撒谎？”

### 2
"Ah, I was trying to be tactful, but if you insist on using that word, I won’t oppose it."

> “啊，我想尽量讲得委婉一点，可你非要用这个字眼的话，我也不反对。”

The millionaire’s face twisted with rage, and he raised his bony, knotted fist. Seeing this, I jumped to my feet.

> 富翁顿时面目狰狞，举起骨节暴突的大拳头，我见状一下子跳了起来。

Holmes lazily smiled and picked up his pipe.

> 福尔摩斯懒洋洋地笑了笑，伸手拿起烟斗。

"Don’t lose your temper, Mr. Gibson. I find even the smallest quarrel after breakfast can ruin one’s mood.

> “别动气，吉布森先生，我发现早饭后再小的争吵也会破坏心情。

Take a walk, get some fresh air, and a little calm will do you a world of good."

> 出去散散步，换换空气，清静一会儿，肯定对你大有好处。”

The mining magnate struggled to suppress his anger. In an instant, the burning fury on his face transformed into an expression of cold arrogance, a display of self-control that was truly impressive.

> 金矿大亨竭力压住愤怒，转眼间，燃烧的怒火又变成了傲慢的冷漠，如此强大的自制力叫人不得不佩服。

"Fine, as you wish. It’s your business, after all. I can’t force you to take the case.

> “好吧，随便你，你的生意你做主，我不能强迫你接案子。

Mr. Holmes, you’re making trouble for yourself. I’ve dealt with tougher men than you, and those who cross me never come out unscathed."

> 福尔摩斯先生，你这是自找麻烦，比你厉害的角色我都对付过，惹毛我的人都没好结果。”

"There are plenty of men who’ve said the same thing, yet here I am, alive and well," Holmes said with a smile.

> “说这话的人多了，可我还是好端端待在这里，”福尔摩斯笑着说，

"Very well. Goodbye, Mr. Gibson. You still have much to learn."

> “行了，再见，吉布森先生，你要学的东西还多着呢。”

The guest stormed out, muttering curses under his breath. Holmes sat in silence, calmly puffing on his pipe, his gaze fixed on the ceiling.

> 客人骂骂咧咧走了，福尔摩斯默不作声，冷静地抽着烟斗，两眼放空地盯着天花板。

"What do you think, Watson?" he finally spoke.

> “华生，你怎么看？”他终于开了口。

"Honestly, Holmes, a man like him would get rid of any obstacle in his way, and his wife might have been one such obstacle—a woman he had grown to despise. Bates made that very clear earlier.

> “说真的，福尔摩斯，他这种人遇上任何绊脚石都会清除干净，而他妻子可能就是一块绊脚石，是他厌弃的对象，之前那个贝茨说得很清楚了。

When I think of all this, I feel…"

> 一想到这些，我就觉得……”

"Exactly. I feel the same."

> “没错，我也有同感。”

"What is his relationship with the governess? And how did you figure it out?"

> “他跟家庭教师什么关系？你又是怎么发现的？”

"Pure bluff, Watson, bluff! His letter was urgent, informal, and unpolished.

> “纯属诈唬，华生，诈唬！他的来信语气迫切，不正规也不正式，

When I saw him in person, his appearance and demeanor were conservative and reserved.

> 再看他本人，外貌举止都是保守风格，

The contrast made it obvious—the woman who stirred his emotions wasn’t the victim, but the accused.

> 对比之下不难看出，让他动情的女人不是死者，而是被告。

To uncover the truth, we must first clarify the relationships between these three people.

> 想查明真相，必须先弄清这三个人到底是什么关系。

You saw it too—my direct attack was easily deflected by him.

> 你也看见了，我的正面进攻被他轻松抵挡。

So I bluffed him, made him think I was certain, though I was merely suspicious."

> 那我就诈唬诈唬他，让他觉得我有十足把握，但其实我也只是怀疑而已。”

"Do you think he’ll come back?"

> “说不定他还会回来？”

"He’ll definitely come back. He has to. He can’t just walk away.

> “肯定会回来，必须回来，他不可能扔下不管。

Ha! The doorbell rings! That must be his footsteps.

> 哈！门铃响了！没错，是他的脚步。

Ah, Mr. Gibson, I was just telling Dr. Watson that you’d be back."

> 嘿，吉布森先生，我刚还在跟华生医生说，你该来了。”

The mining magnate returned to the room, his attitude more subdued than when he had left.

> 金矿大亨重新回到房间，态度比离开时收敛了许多，

However, his eyes still betrayed the resentment of a man whose pride had been wounded, though reason had convinced him to compromise in pursuit of his goal.

> 眼神仍流露出自尊受挫后的怨恨，但理智告诉他，想达到目的，不得不妥协。

"I’ve thought it over carefully, Mr. Holmes. I was too impulsive and misunderstood your intentions.

> “我仔细考虑过了，福尔摩斯先生，是我太冲动，不该误解你的意思。

Whatever the truth may be, it’s entirely reasonable for you to investigate, and I respect you all the more for it.

> 不管实情是什么，你想查问清楚完全合情合理，我也因此更敬重你。

But I can assure you, my relationship with Miss Dunbar has nothing to do with the case."

> 不过我可以保证，我和邓巴小姐的关系跟案子毫不相干。”

"Whether it’s relevant or not is for me to determine, isn’t it?"

> “相不相干得由我来判断，不是吗？”

"Yes, I agree. You’re the doctor; you need to know all the symptoms to make a diagnosis."

> “是，我同意，你就是医生，需要了解所有症状才能下诊断。”

"Exactly. A very apt metaphor. Only a patient deliberately trying to deceive their doctor would conceal symptoms."

> “没错，比喻很恰当，只有刻意欺骗医生的病人才会隐瞒症状。”

"Perhaps, Mr. Holmes. But honestly, most men would hesitate when asked so bluntly about their relationship with a woman, especially if they have genuine feelings.

> “也许吧，福尔摩斯先生，可是老实说，被人这么直白地问及和女人的关系，大多数男人都会有所回避吧，特别是有了真感情的时候。

Deep within most souls lies a small, private territory that doesn’t welcome outsiders.

> 多数人的灵魂深处都有一小块专属领地，不欢迎外人进入，

But you barged right in. Still, since it’s to save her, I won’t hold it against you. Fine, the walls are down, the territory is open.

> 可你就这么硬生生闯了进来。既然是为了救她，我不会跟你计较。好了，围墙倒了，领地开放，

What do you want?"

> 你可以自由探索，想要什么？”

"The truth."

> “真相。”

The millionaire fell silent, seemingly organizing his thoughts. His cold, wrinkled face grew even darker and more serious.

> 金矿大亨不吭声，似乎在整理思绪，爬满皱纹的冷酷脸庞越发阴沉和严肃，

Finally, he spoke:

> 最后说道：

"I’ll keep it brief, Mr. Holmes. Some things are too painful to discuss, so I’ll only say what’s necessary.

> “我简单说说，福尔摩斯先生，有些事情太痛苦，也难以启齿，我就不深入了，只说必要的。

I met my wife, Maria Pinto, in Brazil while prospecting for gold.

> 我在巴西淘金时认识了妻子，玛丽亚·平托是马瑙斯市一个政府官员的女儿，

She was incredibly beautiful. When I was young and passionate—even now, with age and a more critical eye—I still think she had a unique and exquisite beauty.

> 长得非常漂亮。我那时候年轻热情，即使是现在，人更冷静了，眼光也更挑剔了，我依然认为过去的她有种独特而绝妙的美。

She was full of passion, with a rich and vibrant personality, untamed and tropical in spirit, utterly different from any American woman I’d ever known.

> 还有那种浓烈而丰富的天性，充满激情，全心投入，具有热带特色的奔放，跟我认识的美国女人截然不同。

In short, I fell in love with her and married her.

> 总而言之，我爱上了她，跟她结了婚。”

"The deep affection lasted for several years, but it gradually faded.

> “浓情爱意持续了好几年，渐渐淡了下来，

It was then that I realized we had nothing in common.

> 我这才意识到我们之间根本没有共同语言。

I no longer loved her. If only she had stopped loving me, it would’ve been easier.

> 我不爱她了，如果她也不爱我，事情就好办多了。

But women, as you know, are unpredictable!

> 可是女人啊，你知道的，捉摸不透！

No matter what I did, she refused to leave me.

> 不管我做什么，她都不肯离开我。

I treated her poorly—perhaps even cruelly, as some have said—because I wanted to stop her love or make her hate me.

> 我对她不好，甚至像有些人说的有些残忍，那是因为我想阻止她的爱，或者让她恨我，

I thought that would make things easier for both of us.

> 我知道这样会让我们都好受些。

But nothing changed her. The love she had for me twenty years ago on the Amazon River is the same love she has now in the jungles of England.

> 可是什么也改变不了她，二十年前在亚马孙河畔有多爱我，如今在英国丛林间也丝毫不减。

No matter what I did, she remained steadfast."

> 不管我做什么，她都始终如一。”

### 3
"Later, Miss Grace Dunbar arrived. She applied for the job and became the governess of the two children. You might have seen her portrait in the newspapers—she is universally acknowledged as a great beauty.

> “后来格雷斯·邓巴小姐来了。她是应聘来的，当上了两个孩子的家庭教师。你可能在报上看过她的画像，也是所有人公认的大美人。

I won’t pretend to be nobler than others. Let me be honest with you—living under the same roof with such a woman and interacting with her daily, it’s impossible not to feel affection for her.

> 我不想假装比别人高尚，实话对你说吧，跟这样一个女人住在同一屋檐下，天天打交道，不可能不心生爱意。

Mr. Holmes, are you going to blame me for that?"

> 福尔摩斯先生，是不是想责备我？”

"Having feelings isn’t blameworthy, but acting on them is. After all, in a certain sense, you are this young lady’s protector."

> “心里有爱没什么好责备的，但如果表现出来，那就不对了，毕竟从某种意义上说，你是这位年轻女士的保护人。”

"Ah, perhaps."

> “唉，也许吧。”

The millionaire echoed the criticism verbally, but a flash of anger appeared in his eyes.

> 面对指责，富翁虽然嘴上应和着，眼里却又闪过一丝愠怒。

"I am no hypocrite. In my life, whatever I want, I pursue. What I wanted most was this woman and her love, and I confessed to her."

> “我不是伪君子，这辈子想要什么，一定会出手争取。我最想要的就是这个女人和她的爱，我向她坦白了。”

"Oh, you actually told her?"

> “哦，你还真说了啊？”

Holmes, looking stern and commanding, spoke with evident anger.

> 福尔摩斯动起怒来，样子十分威严。

"I told her that if I could marry her, I would. But unfortunately, it wasn’t up to me alone. I said money wasn’t an issue, and I’d do anything to make her happy and comfortable."

> “我告诉她，只要能娶她，我一定娶，可惜不是我一个人说了算。我说钱不是问题，只要能让她高兴、让她舒服，我什么都愿意做。”

"How generous," Holmes said sarcastically.

> “真慷慨。”福尔摩斯讽刺道。

"Listen, Mr. Holmes, I came to you seeking evidence, not moral judgment. I don’t need your criticism."

> “听好了，福尔摩斯先生，我来找你是为了寻求证据，不是接受道德审判，不需要你品头论足。”

"I took your case entirely for the sake of the young lady," Holmes said sternly.

> “我完全是看在年轻女士的分上才接你的案子，”福尔摩斯严厉地说，

"Compared to the accusations against her, what you just admitted is even more disgraceful.

> “跟她受到的指控相比，你刚才承认的事恐怕更加严重。

You brought an unprotected young lady into your home and tried to ruin her.

> 一个毫无防备的女士住在你的屋檐下，你却企图毁了她。

You wealthy people need to be taught a lesson—not everyone will take your money and allow you to act recklessly!"

> 你们这些有钱人就该好好教训一下，不是所有人都会收你们的钱，纵容你们胡作非为。”

To my surprise, the mining magnate accepted the rebuke without protest.

> 令我惊讶的是，金矿大亨这次竟然毫无反抗地接受了斥责。

"I think the same now. Thank heavens my wish didn’t come true. She refused me outright and immediately said she would resign and leave."

> “我现在也是这么想的。谢天谢地，我的愿望并没有实现。她说什么也不肯答应，而且当即表示要辞职离开。”

"Why didn’t she leave then?"

> “后来为什么没走？”

"First of all, she has a family to support. Without an income, they would have no hope—that’s no small matter.

> “首先一点，她得养活家里人，没了生计，他们就没了指望，这可不是小事。

I swore to her—absolutely solemnly—that I would never trouble her again, and only then did she agree to stay.

> 我对她发誓——绝对郑重地发誓——永远不再骚扰她，她才同意留下。

Also, she knew she could influence me more than anyone else could and wanted to use that influence for good."

> 还有一点，她知道自己能影响我，比任何人的影响力都大，想利用这种影响力做点好事。”

"What kind of good?"

> “什么好事？”

"She understood my business. My business is vast, Mr. Holmes—beyond the imagination of ordinary people.

> “她对我的事业有所了解。我的事业做得很大，福尔摩斯先生，一般人根本无法想象。

I hold the power to create and destroy, and usually, I destroy—not just individuals, but corporations, cities, even nations.

> 我掌握着创造和摧毁的力量，通常都是去摧毁，毁掉的不仅仅是个人，还有集团、城市，甚至国家。

Business is ruthless—survival of the fittest.

> 生意场上竞争残酷，弱肉强食，

I’ve fought so hard, never complaining about my own pain, nor caring about others’.

> 我拼死拼活，自己从不叫苦叫痛，也不在乎别人的苦痛。

But she saw things differently. She believed that no man’s wealth should be built on the hardship of ten thousand others.

> 但她的看法不同，她认为一个人的充裕财富不应该建立在一万个人的艰难生活之上。

I thought she made sense. She seemed to see something more enduring than money.

> 我觉得说得在理。她就是这么看的，似乎能看到比金钱更长久的东西。

She realized I was willing to listen to her views and stayed to influence my actions for the better.

> 她发现我愿意接受她的看法，想通过影响我的行动为社会做点好事，所以留了下来，

And then this happened."

> 结果发生了这种事。”

"Can you think of any explanation?"

> “你能想到什么解释吗？”

The mining magnate was silent for a moment, covering his head with his hands and falling deep into thought.

> 金矿大亨沉默片刻，用手捂着脑袋，陷入了沉思。

"I won’t deny that the situation looks very bad for her.

> “我不否认，形势对她非常不利。

The inner world of women is complex, and they may do things that men cannot understand.

> 女人内心世界复杂，可能做出男人无法理解的事。

At first, I was terrified, thinking she had lost her mind and acted completely out of character.

> 我一开始也非常惊慌，以为她一时迷了心窍，完全背离了本性。

But then I considered another explanation. Whether it’s true or not, I’ll tell you what I thought, Mr. Holmes.

> 可是我又想到了一种解释，不论真假，姑且说给你听听，福尔摩斯先生。

My wife was clearly consumed by jealousy. There’s not only jealousy of physical relationships but also of intellectual ones, which can drive people just as mad.

> 我妻子显然燃起了妒火。世上不光有对肉体关系的妒忌，还有对精神关系的妒忌，一样能让人变得疯狂。

Hers wasn’t the former; she knew we had no such relationship.

> 她的妒忌不是前者，她知道我们没有那种关系。

But she also knew this Englishwoman could influence my thoughts and actions in a way she never could.

> 她也知道这个英国女人能影响我的思想行为，而她自己永远也办不到。

Even though this influence was positive, it made no difference. She hated her with a madness that still carried the wildness of the Amazon in her blood.

> 尽管这种影响是好的，依然于事无补。她恨得发了疯，血液里始终保留着亚马孙的狂热。

Perhaps she wanted to kill Miss Dunbar, or maybe she only meant to threaten her with the gun to scare her away.

> 也许她想杀掉邓巴小姐，或者只是用枪威胁，想吓走她。

The two women struggled, the gun went off, and the one holding it was shot."

> 两个女人扭打起来，枪走火，射中了拿枪的那个。”

"I’ve considered that possibility too," Holmes said.

> “这种可能性我也想到了，”福尔摩斯说，

"In fact, it’s the most obvious argument against a charge of deliberate murder."

> “实际上，想驳倒故意杀人罪，这是最明显的理由。”

"Miss Dunbar herself also firmly denies committing murder."

> “邓巴小姐本人也坚决否认杀人。”

"Her denial doesn’t carry much weight, does it?

> “她的否认并不起决定作用，对吧？

A woman in such a terrifying situation might very well run home in panic with the gun, or even throw it in the wardrobe, entirely unaware of what she was doing.

> 一个女人处于那么可怕的境地，完全有可能在慌乱中带着枪跑回家，甚至把枪扔进衣柜，自己做了什么毫无意识。

When the gun is discovered, and there’s no other explanation, she might deny everything in desperation to save herself. How can that assumption be disproved?"

> 等到枪被发现了，没有别的办法解释，只能极力否认，以求脱罪。这种假设怎么推翻呢？”

### 4


"Miss Dunbar is not that kind of person."

> “邓巴小姐不是这种人。”

"Ah, perhaps." Holmes glanced at his watch.

> “啊，也许吧。”福尔摩斯看了看表。

"This morning, I should be able to arrange a permit to visit her in prison, and there’s a train to Winchester this evening.

> “今天上午肯定能办好探监证，傍晚有车到温切斯特。

Once I meet this young lady, I should be better able to investigate your case, but I cannot guarantee the result will be what you hope for."

> 等我见到这位年轻女士，应该能更好地调查你的案子，但我不能保证结果一定如你所愿。”

The official permission was delayed, so we didn’t go to Winchester. Instead, we headed to Thor Manor, which Mr. Gibson had purchased in Hampshire.

> 官方许可迟迟没办好，温切斯特没去成，我们改去了吉布森先生在汉普郡买下的雷神庄园。

He did not accompany us but provided the address of the local police chief.

> 他本人没有同行，不过给了我们当地警长的地址。

Inspector Coventry, the first to handle the case, was a tall, thin man with a pale, grayish complexion.

> 考文垂警长是最先接触案子的人，瘦高个儿，面色灰白，

He gave the impression of knowing or suspecting a lot but not daring to speak openly.

> 给人神秘兮兮的感觉，好像知道或者怀疑的事很多，只是不敢说出来。

He had a peculiar habit of suddenly lowering his voice as if revealing a great secret, even when sharing the most mundane facts.

> 他还有个毛病，说话时突然压低嗓门，像说悄悄话一样，仿佛发现了重大秘密，其实也就是再平常不过的消息。

Aside from these quirks, he was honest, straightforward, and humble, admitting his limitations and need for help.

> 除去这些怪癖，他这人倒还诚实正直，也比较虚心，承认自己能力有限、需要帮助。

"You coming here is better than someone from Scotland Yard, Mr. Holmes," he said.

> “你来总比警察厅的人来好，福尔摩斯先生，”他说，

"When Scotland Yard gets involved, the local police get no credit and still take the blame if the case isn’t solved.

> “警察厅的人一插手，地方警察没功劳不说，破不了案还得挨批。

I’ve heard you’re always fair."

> 我听说你一向很公正。”

"I don’t even want my face to be seen, and my name doesn’t need to be mentioned if the case is solved."

> “我连脸都不想露，破了案也不用提我的名字。”

Hearing this, our gloomy new acquaintance visibly relaxed.

> 听福尔摩斯这么说，闷闷不乐的新朋友显然松了口气。

"You are indeed very generous. And your companion, Dr. Watson, I’ve heard, is also a reliable man.

> “你确实非常大度，还有你的朋友华生医生，我知道也是个靠得住的人。

Well then, Mr. Holmes, before we visit the crime scene, I have a question. I haven’t mentioned this to anyone else."

> 好了，福尔摩斯先生，去现场之前，我有个问题想请教。除了你，我谁都没说。”

He glanced around cautiously, as if afraid to speak out loud.

> 他朝周围瞟了瞟，好像不敢开口似的，

"Do you think Mr. Neil Gibson is a suspect?"

> “你觉不觉得尼尔·吉布森先生有嫌疑？”

"I’ve considered the possibility."

> “这个问题我考虑过。”

"You’ve never met Miss Dunbar. She’s an absolutely charming woman.

> “你是没见过邓巴小姐，怎么看都是个魅力十足的女人。

He might have wanted to remove his wife as an obstacle. And these Americans are different from us—they often resort to guns.

> 他可能想扫除妻子这个障碍，而且这些美国人跟我们不一样，动不动就用枪。

The gun was his, you know?"

> 枪是他的，你知道吧？”

"Are you certain?"

> “确定吗？”

"Absolutely certain, sir. It was one of a pair of guns."

> “非常确定，先生，是一对枪中的一把。”

"One of a pair? Where’s the other one?"

> “一对枪中的一把？另一把呢？”

"Well, sir, he owns so many firearms that we haven’t found the exact match, but the gun case clearly holds a pair."

> “唉，这位先生的枪支实在太多了，我们没找到完全匹配的那把，但枪盒显然是装一对用的。”

"If they were a pair, the match shouldn’t be hard to find."

> “如果真是一对，不可能找不到匹配的那把。”

"If you want to examine them, I can gather all his firearms for you."

> “你要是想去看看，我们可以把他家的枪支都集中起来。”

"Later, perhaps. Let’s visit the scene of the tragedy first."

> “晚点再说吧，还是先一起去惨案现场看看。”

Inspector Coventry’s humble country residence served as the local police station, and the conversation took place in its cramped front room.

> 考文垂警长简陋的乡间小屋就是当地的警局，以上对话发生在狭小的前厅。

From there, we walked about half a mile into the wind, crossing a wilderness dyed golden-brown by withered bracken, to reach a side gate of Thor Manor.

> 从那里步行约半英里，顶风穿过被枯萎的蕨草染成金铜色的荒野，到了雷神庄园的偏门。

Following a path through the pheasant preserves, we arrived at a clearing.

> 再沿小路穿过雉鸡场，到了一块空地。

From there, we could see the grand house atop a hill. It was a mix of Tudor and Georgian architecture, constructed of brick and timber.

> 可以看见山坡顶上的大房子，砖木结构，融合了都铎王朝和乔治王朝的风格。

Beside us was a long, narrow lake surrounded by reeds.

> 我们旁边有片长形湖，四周长满芦苇。

At its narrowest point, a stone bridge arched across, wide enough for carriages. The lake spread out on both sides of the bridge.

> 湖面的中心位置最窄，上方立了一座石桥，可供马车通行，湖面从桥两侧延展开去。

Our guide stopped at the bridgehead and pointed to the ground.

> 我们的向导在桥头停住，指向地面。

"Mrs. Gibson’s body was found here. I’ve marked the spot with a stone."

> “吉布森太太的尸体在这儿，我用石头做了记号。”

"You didn’t move anything before you arrived, did you?"

> “你来之前应该没挪动过吧？”

"No, sir. I was notified immediately."

> “没有，他们第一时间通知了我。”

"Who reported it?"

> “谁让报的警？”

"Mr. Gibson himself. As soon as he heard the news, he rushed down from the house with others, forbade anyone from disturbing the scene, and waited for the police."

> “吉布森先生本人。他一听到消息，立刻带人从房子那边冲下来，严禁任何人破坏现场，等警察来处理。”

"Very prudent. I read in the papers that the shot was fired at close range."

> “很明智。我从报上得知，开枪距离很近。”

"Yes, sir, very close."

> “对，先生，非常近。”

"Near the right temple?"

> “靠近右边太阳穴？”

"A little behind the temple."

> “太阳穴稍后一点。”

"And the body’s position?"

> “死者倒地姿势呢？”

"On her back. There were no signs of struggle, no footprints, and no weapon.

> “仰面。没有打斗迹象，没有脚印，没有凶器。

In her left hand, she was clutching a note from Miss Dunbar."

> 左手紧握邓巴小姐的字条。”

"Clutching it?"

> “紧握？”

"Yes, sir. We had difficulty prying her fingers open."

> “是的，先生，我们好不容易才掰开她的手指。”

"That’s crucial. It proves the note wasn’t planted after her death, ruling out forgery. Excellent!

> “这点至关重要，说明字条不是死后放的，排除了制造假证的可能。很好！

If I recall correctly, the note was brief: ‘I will be at Thor Bridge at nine. G. Dunbar.’ Right?"

> 没记错的话，字条内容很短：‘我九点到雷神桥。G.邓巴。’对吧？”

"Correct."

> “没错。”

"Did Miss Dunbar admit to writing it?"

> “邓巴小姐承认是她写的吗？”

"She did."

> “承认了。”

"What’s her explanation?"

> “她怎么解释？”

"She refused to say anything, insisting she would explain at the trial."

> “她什么也不肯说，说是要留到巡回法庭上解释。”

"This case is fascinating. The note is clearly a key point, isn’t it?"

> “这案子太有意思了。字条显然是疑点，不是吗？”

"Sir, if I may be frank," the inspector said,

> “先生，恕我斗胆直言，”警探说，

"The note is the most compelling piece of evidence in the entire case."

> “字条是整个案子中最确凿的证据了。”

Holmes shook his head.

> 福尔摩斯摇摇头。

"The note is genuine, written by Miss Dunbar. Therefore, Mrs. Gibson must have received it before the incident—perhaps an hour or two earlier.

> “字条是真的，确实是邓巴小姐写的，那么，吉布森太太肯定是在事发前收到的——也许是一两个小时前吧。

If so, why was she still clutching it? Why carry it so carefully?

> 既然如此，为什么还把字条攥在手里？为什么要这样小心翼翼带在身上？

One doesn’t need a note to attend a meeting. Isn’t that suspicious?"

> 见个面又不需要看字条。难道不可疑吗？”

"Hmm, now that you mention it, it does seem suspicious."

> “嗯，你这么一说，还真有点儿可疑。”

### 5
"I want to sit quietly for a while and think."

> “我想静静坐一会儿，好好想一想。”

He sat down on the stone railing, his sharp gray eyes quickly scanning the surroundings with a questioning gaze.

> 他坐到石护栏上，敏锐的灰眼睛迅速扫视四周，眼神充满疑问。

Suddenly, he jumped up, rushed to the opposite railing, pulled a magnifying glass from his pocket, and began to examine it closely.

> 突然，他跳起身，冲向对面的护栏，从口袋里掏出放大镜，仔细检查起来。

"Strange," he said.

> “奇怪。”他说。

"Yes, sir, we noticed the notch on the railing too—it’s probably the work of a passerby."

> “是啊，先生，我们也看见护栏上的缺口了，多半是路人干的。”

The stone railing was gray, except for one spot about the size of a sixpence, which appeared white. A closer look revealed that the surface had been chipped by something.

> 石护栏是灰色的，唯有一处是白的，差不多六便士硬币那么大，细看会发现，表面好像被什么东西撞掉了一块。

"It would take some force to chip it," Holmes said thoughtfully.

> “这要花点力气才撞得掉。”福尔摩斯若有所思地说着，

He tapped the railing several times with his walking stick but left no marks.

> 拿起手杖敲了好几下，没留下任何痕迹，

"Yes, it was indeed a hard blow. The location is also peculiar, near the lower edge of the railing, indicating the impact came from below, not above."

> “没错，确实是猛击。这个位置也很奇怪，靠近护栏的下边缘，说明撞击来自下方，不是上方。”

"But this spot is at least fifteen feet from the body."

> “可是这里距离尸体至少十五英尺。”

"Yes, fifteen feet. Perhaps it has nothing to do with the case, but it’s worth noting. There’s nothing more to see here.

> “对，是有十五英尺，也许跟案子毫无关系，但值得注意。这地方没什么可看了。

You mentioned there were no footprints?"

> 你刚才说没有脚印？”

"The ground is harder than iron—there’s not a single mark."

> “地面比铁还硬，一点痕迹也没有。”

"Then let’s move on. We’ll check out the firearms at the house first, then head to Winchester and meet Miss Dunbar before deciding the next step."

> “那就撤吧。先去房子那儿看看你说的枪支，然后去温切斯特，见过邓巴小姐以后再看下一步。”

Mr. Gibson had not yet returned from the city, but we met Mr. Bates, the anxious guest we had encountered earlier in the morning.

> 吉布森先生还没从城里回来，我们在他家见到了上午那位焦虑不安的客人贝茨先生。

He had a strong interest in firearms and gave us a tour of an intimidating collection, showcasing a variety of designs and models accumulated by his employer over a lifetime of adventure.

> 他对枪械也颇有爱好，带我们参观了一大堆让人望而生畏的枪支，样式、型号各不相同，都是他主人在一辈子冒险中积累下来的。

"Anyone familiar with Mr. Gibson and his ways knows he has plenty of enemies.

> “了解吉布森先生和他的做事风格的人都清楚，他的仇人不会少。

He even keeps a loaded pistol in the drawer by his bed while he sleeps.

> 他连睡觉都要在床边抽屉放一把上膛的手枪。

He worships violence, sir, and sometimes we’re all scared to death of him. That poor woman who died must have lived in constant fear too."

> 他崇尚暴力，先生，有时候我们都怕他怕得要命，那位死掉的可怜女人肯定也经常担惊受怕。”

"Have you ever seen him physically harm her?"

> “你见过他对她动粗？”

"No, but I’ve heard the things he says. His words—sharp and cruel—were no less harmful than physical abuse.

> “那倒没有，但我听到了他说的话，完全不亚于身体上的伤害，

He would mock her bitterly, sometimes even in front of the servants."

> 全是尖酸刻薄的嘲讽，有时甚至当着用人的面说。”

On the way to the station, Holmes remarked,

> 去车站的路上，福尔摩斯说：

"This millionaire’s private life is truly unimpressive.

> “这位富翁的私人生活真是乏善可陈啊。

Watson, we’ve gathered quite a bit of evidence, including some new discoveries, yet I still can’t draw a conclusion.

> 华生，我们掌握了不少证据，有些是新发现，可我还是无法得出结论。

Mr. Bates clearly despises his employer, but he honestly told me that when the news broke, Mr. Gibson was indeed in his study.

> 贝茨先生显然对主人厌恶至极，但他实话告诉我，出事消息传来时，吉布森先生确实待在书房里。

Dinner ended at 8:30, and everything was normal before that.

> 晚餐八点半结束，那以前一切正常。

Although the news came late at night, the tragedy must have occurred at the time stated on the note.

> 虽然消息是深夜传来，惨案无疑是字条上那个时间发生的。

Mr. Gibson returned from the city at five o’clock and has no evidence of leaving the house afterward.

> 吉布森先生五点钟从城里回家，没有任何证据表明他之后出过门。

Additionally, based on what we know, Miss Dunbar admitted to arranging the meeting at the bridge but, on her lawyer’s advice, has revealed nothing further before the trial.

> 另外，据已知情况看，邓巴小姐承认和吉布森太太约在石桥见面，但律师建议她开庭后再公开辩词，所以她什么也没透露。

I have several key questions to ask this young lady. Only after meeting her will I feel at ease.

> 我有几个关键问题要问这位年轻女士，见到她才能安心。

Frankly, if not for one particular detail, even I would find her situation extremely unfavorable."

> 老实说，要不是因为一样东西，连我都觉得形势对她非常不利。”

"What detail, Holmes?"

> “什么东西，福尔摩斯？”

"The pistol in her wardrobe."

> “她衣柜里的手枪。”

"My goodness, Holmes!" I exclaimed.

> “天啊，福尔摩斯！”我叫道，

"I thought that was the most damning piece of evidence."

> “我以为这是最确凿的罪证。”

"It’s not, Watson. From the very beginning, I found this detail particularly odd.

> “并不是，华生。刚开始粗略了解案情，我就觉得这一点特别奇怪。

As I delved deeper, it became the only breakthrough.

> 随着深入接触，这一点成了唯一的突破口。

Everything has to make sense, and when something doesn’t, we must suspect there’s a flaw."

> 凡事都要说得通，一旦说不通了，就要怀疑是不是有漏洞。”

"I don’t quite understand."

> “我不太明白。”

"Let’s put it this way, Watson. Imagine you’re a woman planning to eliminate a rival in cold blood.

> “这样吧，华生，暂且假设你是一个女人，预谋用冷血的方式除掉情敌。

You make the arrangements, write the note, and lure your target to the meeting.

> 你安排妥当，写好字条，对方赴约，

You pull the trigger and execute the crime with precision.

> 你掏枪实施犯罪，整个过程娴熟而完美。

A criminal this skilled would logically dispose of the weapon in the nearby reed-filled lake, hiding it forever.

> 手段这么高明的罪犯，照理说应该把凶器扔进邻近的芦苇湖，永远掩盖下去，

Instead, you carefully carry the gun home and place it in your wardrobe, the easiest place for police to find it. Does that make sense?

> 而你偏偏要毁了自己的高手名声，小心翼翼带着枪回家，放进自己的衣柜，那可是最容易被搜到的地方，说得通吗？

Watson, even though you’re not known for being a master planner, you wouldn’t make such a foolish mistake."

> 华生，熟悉你的朋友都知道你不是策划高手，但也不至于做出这么失策的事吧。”

"Perhaps it was a moment of passion…"

> “也许一时激动……”

"No, no, Watson. I don’t agree with that argument.

> “不对，不对，华生，我并不认同这种说法。

If someone was calm enough to plan the crime, they would also plan their defense.

> 既然冷静地考虑了作案手段，也一定会冷静地想好脱罪方法，

That’s why I believe what we see is merely a façade."

> 所以我确信我们看到的只是假象。”

"But there are so many questions!"

> “可是疑问太多了。”

"Indeed, and we’re off to find the answers.

> “嗯，我们这就去寻找答案。

Once you shift your perspective, what seemed like damning evidence becomes a clue to the truth.

> 一旦转换了视角，原来的罪证会变成通向真相的线索，

The pistol is the perfect example.

> 手枪就是最好的例子。

Miss Dunbar claims she knew nothing about the gun. From our new perspective, she’s telling the truth.

> 邓巴小姐说她根本不知道手枪的事，从我们的新视角看，她说的是实话，

In other words, the gun was planted in her wardrobe by someone else.

> 也就是说，枪是别人放到她衣柜的。

Who planted it? Naturally, the person trying to frame her, who must also be the real murderer.

> 谁放的呢？当然是想陷害她的人，而这个人不正是真正的凶手吗？

You see, we’ve already uncovered a valuable lead."

> 看，这么快就收获了一条有用的线索。”

### 6
"The official procedures had not been completed, so we had to spend the night in Winchester.

> “官方手续还没办好，我们不得不在温切斯特过夜。

The next morning, accompanied by Mr. Joyce Cummings, we were finally able to visit the young lady in prison.

> 第二天上午，在乔伊斯·卡明斯先生的陪同下，我们才得以进监狱探视那位年轻女士。

Mr. Cummings, a rising star in the legal profession, was the defense lawyer for the accused.

> 卡明斯先生是律界新星，此次担任被告律师。

Having heard others praise Miss Dunbar, I expected her to be beautiful, but seeing her in person left an even deeper impression.

> 听过别人对邓巴小姐的评价，我料到会是一位美丽的女人，但亲眼见到时，还是留下了极其深刻的印象。

It was no wonder even the domineering millionaire recognized in her a force more powerful than himself—a force capable of controlling and guiding him.

> 难怪连霸道富翁也在她身上看到了比自己还强大的力量——一种能控制他、指引他的力量。

Her face was well-defined and resolute, yet gentle, giving the impression that even her impulses were tempered by an innate nobility that directed her toward good.

> 那张脸轮廓分明，坚定却不失温柔，让人感觉就算她有冲动的时候，天性中的高贵也总能赋予她向善的力量。

She had deep brown hair, a tall and graceful figure, and an air of dignity and elegance.

> 她一头深褐色头发，个子高挑，姿态庄重优雅。

Yet her dark eyes betrayed a look of pleading and helplessness, like a trapped animal sensing the net closing in but unable to escape.

> 可是黑眼睛却流露出恳求和无助，好像落网的猎物，觉察到网正在收拢，却找不到出路。

When she realized that the famous detective had come to help her, a faint blush appeared on her pale cheeks, and a glimmer of hope shone in her eyes as she looked at us.

> 当她发现著名侦探来帮忙，苍白的脸颊终于有了一丝血色，看向我们的眼神也闪烁着希望。

"Mr. Neil Gibson must have told you about us?" she asked softly, her voice trembling.

> “尼尔·吉布森先生应该跟你说过我们之间的事吧？”她轻声问道，声音颤抖。

"He has," Holmes replied.

> “说了，”福尔摩斯回答，

"You don’t need to trouble yourself with such matters.

> “你不必为难自己讲这种事。

Having met you, I have reason to believe Mr. Gibson was truthful.

> 见到你本人，我有理由相信吉布森先生说的是真话。

You indeed influence him, and your relationship with him is indeed innocent.

> 你确实能影响他，你们之间的关系也确实清白。

But why didn’t you explain this clearly in the magistrates’ court?"

> 可是为什么不在治安法庭上解释清楚呢？”

"I thought such an absurd accusation would never stand.

> “我以为这么荒唐的指控不可能成立。

I believed that if I waited, the truth would reveal itself.

> 只要再等等，真相自会大白。

There was no need to expose the sordid details of our family life.

> 没必要把家庭生活的不堪细节暴露出来。

But instead of clarifying things, the situation only worsened."

> 没想到不但没澄清，反而越来越严重。”

"Kind lady," Holmes said earnestly and loudly,

> “善良的女士啊，”福尔摩斯恳切地大声说，

"please don’t harbor illusions about this matter.

> “请不要在这个问题上抱有幻想。

Mr. Cummings will confirm that the current situation is extremely unfavorable to us.

> 卡明斯先生可以证明，目前的形势对我们十分不利。

To turn the tide, we must give it our all.

> 想要翻盘，必须全力以赴。

I won’t comfort you by saying the danger is minimal—that would be self-deception.

> 我不想安慰你说危险不大，那是自欺欺人。

Please tell me everything you know to help me uncover the truth."

> 请把你知道的全部告诉我，帮我查明真相。”

"I will hold nothing back."

> “我绝不隐瞒。”

"Very well. Tell me about your relationship with Mrs. Gibson."

> “那好，说说你和吉布森太太的关系。”

"She hated me, Mr. Holmes, with the passionate hatred of a tropical woman.

> “她恨我，福尔摩斯先生，带着热带女人天生的狂热憎恨我。

She was a woman who poured her entire soul into anything she did.

> 她是个做什么都会投入百分百情感的女人。

She loved her husband as intensely as she hated me.

> 有多爱丈夫，就有多恨我。

It was all due to her misunderstanding of my relationship with him.

> 显然是误会了我和他之间的关系。

I don’t want to speak ill of her, but her love was purely physical.

> 我不想说她是非，但她爱得浓烈是肉体意义上的。

She could not comprehend the intellectual and spiritual bond between her husband and me, nor my desire to stay and positively influence him.

> 完全无法理解她丈夫在头脑乃至精神层面和我的联系，更无法理解我留下来只是为了正面影响他。

Now I realize I was wrong.

> 我现在明白了，是我错了。

I brought pain to others and should never have stayed.

> 我已经造成了别人的痛苦，说什么也不该留下来。

But even if I had left, that pain would not have disappeared."

> 不过可以肯定的是，就算我走了，那种痛苦也不会随之消失。”

"Alright, Miss Dunbar," Holmes said,

> “好了，邓巴小姐，”福尔摩斯说，

"please tell me the truth about what happened that night."

> “请如实说说当晚发生的事。”

"I can tell you everything I know, but I can’t prove anything.

> “我可以把知道的情况都告诉你，但我什么也证明不了。

There are some things—critical things—that I cannot explain, no matter how I try."

> 有些情况——至关重要的情况——我无法解释，根本不可能解释。”

"You only need to provide the details. Leave the explanations to others."

> “你只需提供细节，解释的事可以交给其他人。”

"I went to Thor Bridge that night because I received a note from Mrs. Gibson that morning.

> “我那天晚上出现在雷神桥，是因为上午收到了吉布森太太的字条。

It was left on the desk in the schoolroom, presumably by her.

> 字条放在教室桌上，应该是她亲自放的。

She begged me to meet her at Thor Bridge after dinner, saying she had something important to tell me.

> 她恳请我晚饭后去雷神桥见面，说有要事相告。

She also asked me to leave my reply at the sundial in the garden and to ensure no one else knew.

> 还让我把回信放在花园的日晷上，不希望任何人知道。

Although I didn’t think secrecy was necessary, I did as she asked and replied that I would meet her.

> 虽然我觉得没必要保密，但还是照她说的做了，回信答应去见她。

She asked me to destroy her note, so I threw it into the schoolroom fireplace and burned it.

> 她要我销毁她的字条，我扔进教室的壁炉烧了。

She was terrified of her husband, who treated her cruelly.

> 她非常害怕丈夫，他对她冷酷无情。

I often reproached him for this.

> 我因此经常责备他。

I think her secrecy was to prevent him from knowing about our meeting.

> 她之所以这么神神秘秘，可能是不想让他知道我们碰面。

That’s the only reason I can think of."

> 这是我能想到的唯一原因。”

"But she carefully kept your note?"

> “你的字条她却小心保存着？”

"Yes, I was surprised to hear she was clutching it when she died."

> “是啊，听说她死时抓着字条，我也吃了一惊。”

"What happened next?"

> “后来呢？”

"I went to the bridge as agreed. She was waiting for me.

> “我按约定去了。到了雷神桥，她正等着我。

It was only then that I realized how much this poor woman hated me.

> 也就是在那时候，我才意识到这个可怜人有多恨我。

She was like a madwoman—no, she *was* a madwoman.

> 她像发了疯一样——不，她就是疯子。

Only a madwoman could harbor such hidden, burning hatred.

> 只有疯子才有那股深藏不露的疯狂。

She saw me daily without showing any sign, yet inside, she was consumed by such intense resentment.

> 她每天跟我见面，完全不动声色，内心却燃烧着如此强烈的仇恨。

Isn’t that madness?

> 不是疯是什么？

I won’t repeat her words—they were the most violent and vile accusations.

> 我不想重复她的话，她用了最激烈、最难听的言语宣泄满腔怒火。

I didn’t respond because I couldn’t.

> 我没有回应，根本不可能回应。

Her appearance was so dreadful I couldn’t bear to look at her.

> 她那副可怕的样子实在叫人看不下去。

I covered my ears with my hands and ran away.

> 我用手捂住耳朵跑走了。

When I left, she was still standing at the bridge railing, screaming curses."

> 我离开时，她还站在桥头尖声咒骂。”

"Was it the place where her body was found?"

> “是发现尸体的地方吗？”

"A few yards away."

> “离那里只有几码远。”

### 7
"Suppose she died shortly after you left. Didn’t you hear the gunshot?"

> “假如她是在你离开后不久死的，你没听到枪声？”

"No, I didn’t hear anything. To be honest, Mr. Holmes, I was so shaken by her sudden outburst that I was too upset to notice anything around me.

> “没有，什么也没听见。说实话，福尔摩斯先生，我被这突如其来的怒骂吓坏了，心烦意乱，只想着赶紧回自己房间静一静，没怎么留意周围的动静。”

"You said you went back to your room. Did you come out again that evening?"

> “你说回了房间，当晚有再出来吗？”

"Yes, when the news came that the poor woman was dead, I ran out with the others."

> “有，消息传来，说那个可怜人死了，我和其他人一起跑了出去。”

"Did you see Mr. Gibson?"

> “有看见吉布森先生吗？”

"Yes, I saw him when he returned from the bridge. He had already sent for the doctor and the police."

> “有，我看见他时，他刚从桥那边回来，已经派人去叫医生和警察。”

"Did he seem agitated?"

> “他看上去慌乱吗？”

"Mr. Gibson is a tough and reserved man who rarely shows his emotions.

> “吉布森先生是个强硬、内敛的人，从不轻易表露情绪。

But I know him well enough to tell he was extremely anxious."

> 不过我太了解他了，确实能看出他非常焦虑。”

"Here’s the most critical point. The gun was found in your room. Had you ever seen it before?"

> “接下来是最关键的一点。枪是在你房间发现的，你以前见过吗？”

"I swear, I had never seen it before."

> “我发誓，从没见过。”

"When was it discovered?"

> “什么时候发现的？”

"The next morning, during the police search."

> “第二天早上，警察搜查的时候。”

"Was it found among your clothes?"

> “和你的衣服放在一起？”

"Yes, under the clothes, on the wardrobe floor."

> “对，衣服下面，衣柜底板上。”

"How long do you think it had been there?"

> “你估计在那儿放了多久？”

"It wasn’t there the morning before."

> “反正头天早上还没有。”

"How can you be so sure?"

> “你怎么知道？”

"Because I had tidied the wardrobe that morning."

> “我那时候整理过衣柜。”

"It’s certain, then—someone entered your room and planted the gun to frame you."

> “铁定无疑了，有人进过你房间，把枪放在那儿陷害你。”

"That must be the case."

> “肯定是这样。”

"When could it have been planted?"

> “什么时候放的呢？”

"Either during dinner or when I was teaching the children in the schoolroom."

> “不是吃饭时间，就是我在教室给孩子们上课的时候。”

"You received the note in the schoolroom as well?"

> “你也是在教室收到字条的？”

"Yes, I spent the entire morning in the schoolroom after receiving the note."

> “对，收到字条后整个上午都在教室。”

"Thank you, Miss Dunbar. Is there any other information that might aid the investigation?"

> “谢谢，邓巴小姐，还有其他有助调查的信息吗？”

"No, that’s all."

> “没了。”

"There’s a new notch on the bridge railing, a mark of impact, directly facing the body. Can you think of any explanation?"

> “桥护栏上有个新留下的小缺口，是撞击的痕迹，正对着尸体。你能想到什么解释吗？”

"It must just be a coincidence."

> “肯定只是巧合罢了。”

"Strange, Miss Dunbar, very strange. Why did it happen to appear at the exact time and place of the tragedy?"

> “奇怪，邓巴小姐，太奇怪了，为什么正巧在惨案时间出现在惨案地点？”

"But it would take a strong blow to leave such a mark. What could have caused it?"

> “可是，只有猛击才能撞成那个样子，会是什么造成的呢？”

Holmes didn’t answer. His pale, earnest face suddenly tensed, and he stared into the distance with a vacant expression.

> 福尔摩斯没回答，苍白诚挚的脸突然紧绷，露出放空的神情。

I knew this look—it meant his mind was operating at its highest capacity.

> 我知道这是他的才智发挥到极致的表现。

His brain was clearly racing, and none of us dared to make a sound.

> 他的大脑显然在高速运转，我们谁也不敢出声。

The lawyer, the accused, and I all sat there, holding our breath and watching him.

> 律师、疑犯和我坐在那儿，屏息凝神地盯着他。

Suddenly, he leapt to his feet, trembling with excitement as if ready to spring into action.

> 他猛一下跳起身，一副蓄势待发的样子，激动得浑身颤抖。

"Let’s go, Watson, quickly!" he shouted.

> “快走，华生，快！”他叫道。

"What is it, Mr. Holmes?"

> “怎么了，福尔摩斯先生？”

"Nothing, my dear lady. Mr. Cummings, I’ll be in touch with you.

> “没事，亲爱的小姐。卡明斯先生，我会跟你联系。

With the help of the goddess of justice, I’ll win you a case that will be celebrated across the nation.

> 借助正义之神的力量，我会让你赢一场享誉全国的官司。

Miss Dunbar, you’ll hear from me tomorrow. Rest assured, the clouds are lifting, and the light of truth is breaking through."

> 邓巴小姐，你明天会收到消息。尽管放心好了，阴云即将散去，真相之光就要破云而出了。”

The journey from Winchester to Thor Manor wasn’t long, but my eagerness made it feel endless.

> 从温切斯特到雷神庄园的路程并不长，但我心情迫切，度秒如年。

For Holmes, it seemed even more interminable.

> 更别提福尔摩斯了，这段路对他来说似乎永无尽头。

He was restless, unable to sit still, either pacing the carriage or drumming his sensitive fingers on the seat beside him.

> 他心急如焚，坐也坐不住，要么在车厢里走来走去，要么用灵敏的长手指敲打身旁的坐垫。

We were in a first-class carriage, just the two of us.

> 我们坐的是头等车厢，只有我们两个人。

As we neared our destination, he suddenly sat across from me, placed a hand on my knee, and gave me a mischievous look.

> 目的地快到了，他突然坐到我对面，一手搭住我的一个膝盖，狡黠地盯着我的眼睛。

"Watson," he said, "I recall you always carry a gun when we go out."

> “华生，”他说，“我记得我们每次出来你都带着枪。”

I carried a gun for his protection. Once he became fully engrossed in a case, he often neglected his personal safety, and my gun had saved him more than once.

> 我带枪是为他好，他一旦全身心投入到案子里，完全不考虑个人安危，我的枪不止一次救他于危难。

I reminded him of this fact.

> 我提醒他注意这个事实。

"Yes, yes, I’m quite careless in such matters. But did you bring it this time?"

> “没错，没错，我对这种事确实有点儿马虎。你到底带没带枪？”

I pulled the gun from my back pocket. It was small, portable, and very practical.

> 我从裤子后袋掏出枪，这把枪短小便携，非常实用。

He opened the chamber, emptied the bullets, and examined it carefully.

> 他打开枪栓，倒出子弹，仔细检查了一番。

"It’s heavy—very solid," he said.

> “挺压手的，非常沉。”他说。

"Yes, it’s a sturdy weapon."

> “是的，这枪结实得很。”

He stared at the gun for a while longer.

> 他又盯着枪看了一会儿。

"You know, Watson, your gun is closely connected to the mystery we’re investigating."

> “知道吗，华生，你的枪跟我们正在调查的谜案有着密不可分的关系？”

"My goodness, Holmes, don’t joke about that."

> “天啊，福尔摩斯，别开玩笑了。”

"No, Watson, I’m serious. We’re about to conduct an experiment, and if it succeeds, everything will become clear.

> “不，华生，我是认真的。我们将要做一个实验，实验成功，一切都会明朗。

The key lies in the performance of this little revolver.

> 关键就看这把小手枪的表现了。

Remove one bullet, leave the remaining five in the chamber, and close it.

> 拿掉一颗子弹，其余五颗放回弹膛，关上枪栓。

There! Its weight will increase, and the experiment will work even better."

> 好了！枪的重量增加，实验效果更好。”

"I had no idea what he wanted to do, and he didn’t explain much. He just sat there, lost in thought, until the train pulled into the small station in Hampshire.

> “我完全不清楚他想做什么，他也不多解释，只是坐在那儿发呆，一直到火车驶进汉普郡的小车站。”

We rented an old carriage and, a quarter of an hour later, arrived at the mysterious inspector’s house.

> “我们租了辆破旧的马车，一刻钟后，到了神秘兮兮的警长家。”

"Any leads, Mr. Holmes? What is it?"

> “有线索了吗，福尔摩斯先生？是什么？”

"It depends on how Dr. Watson’s revolver performs," my friend said.

> “就看华生医生的手枪表现如何了，”我朋友说，

"This one. Now, Inspector, can you provide me with a ten-yard-long rope?"

> “就是这把。好了，警长，能给我一根十码长的绳子吗？”

The village shop supplied a sturdy coil of rope.

> “村里的商店提供了一团结实的绳子。”

"Everything is ready," Holmes said.

> “东西都齐备了，”福尔摩斯说，

"Good, let’s begin the final leg of our journey."

> “好，我们一起开启最后一段旅程吧。”

The sun was setting, and the rolling Hampshire countryside turned into a beautiful autumnal scene under the evening light.

> “太阳西沉，汉普郡连绵的荒野在夕照下变成了一幅美好的秋色画卷。”

The inspector shuffled along beside us, occasionally shooting critical and doubtful glances at my friend, clearly questioning his sanity.

> “警长摇摇晃晃跟在我们旁边，时不时看一眼我朋友，眼神充满挑剔和质疑，显然对他神志是否清醒深表怀疑。”

As we approached the crime scene, my friend maintained his usual composure, but I could tell he was deeply unsettled.

> “案发现场越来越近，我朋友虽然保持着平时的镇定，但我看得出来，他内心其实非常不安。”

"Yes," he said, responding to my thoughts,

> “是啊，”他回应了我的想法，

"You’ve seen me fail before, Watson. My instincts are usually accurate, but they sometimes play tricks on me.

> “你以前看过我失手，华生，我的直觉准是准，但有时也会跟我开个玩笑。”

In Winchester Prison, I had a sudden flash of inspiration and thought I had the solution.

> “在温切斯特监狱，我突然灵光一现，觉得找到了正解。”

But the drawback of an active mind is that it can always come up with alternative explanations to undermine its previous conclusions.

> “可是活跃的头脑有个缺点，总是能想出其他解释否定之前的答案。”

No matter, no matter, Watson. There’s no harm in trying."

> “没事，没事，华生，试试也无妨。”

As he walked, he firmly tied one end of the rope to the revolver’s handle.

> “他一边走，一边用绳子一头牢牢系住枪柄。”

At the crime scene, with the inspector’s help, he carefully marked the exact position of the body.

> “到了惨案现场，在警探的协助下，他小心翼翼标出尸体的精确位置。”

Then, he found a large stone among the heather and bracken, tied the other end of the rope to it, and lowered it over the bridge railing until it was close to the water’s surface.

> “然后在石楠和蕨草丛中找到一块巨大的石头，用绳子另一头绑住，吊着从桥护栏往下放，直到贴近水面为止。”

He stood at the position of the body, some distance from the bridge’s edge, holding my revolver.

> “他站到尸体的位置，离桥边有一段距离，手里拿着我的枪。”

The rope was taut between the gun and the heavy stone on the other end.

> “绳子在枪和另一头的重石之间紧绷起来。”

"Start!" he shouted.

> “开始！”他叫道。”

As soon as he spoke, he raised the gun to the side of his head and let go.

> “话音刚落，他把枪举到脑袋旁，松开了手。”

In an instant, the gun was yanked by the heavy stone, hitting the railing with a sharp crack before flying over it and plunging into the water.

> “刹那间，枪被重石拽飞，撞到护栏上，发出刺耳的噼啪声，然后越过护栏掉进了水中。”

Holmes immediately knelt by the railing and let out an excited cry, clearly satisfied with the experiment’s result.

> “福尔摩斯立刻跪到护栏旁，兴奋地叫了一声，看来实验结果正如他所料。”

"Is there any more conclusive evidence than this?" he exclaimed.

> “还有比这更确凿的证据吗？”他叫道，

"See, Watson, your revolver has solved the mystery!"

> “看吧，华生，你的手枪解决了问题！”

He pointed to the lower edge of the stone railing, where a new notch identical in shape and size to the previous one had appeared.

> “说着他指向石护栏的下边缘，那里又出现了一个缺口，形状、大小跟之前那个完全相同。”

The inspector stared in astonishment.

> “警长看得目瞪口呆。”

Holmes stood up and turned to him.

> “福尔摩斯站起来，转身对他说：”

"We’ll stay at the inn tonight.

> “我们今晚住旅馆。”

You can use a grappling hook to retrieve my friend’s revolver—it should be easy to find.

> “你可以弄个抓钩来捞捞，很容易捞到我朋友的手枪。”

There should be another one nearby, also tied to a heavy object.

> “旁边应该还有一把，同样用绳子连着重物。”

That vengeful woman tried to cover her crime with these but ended up framing an innocent person for murder.

> “那个报复心极强的女人用这些掩盖了自己的罪，却让一个无辜者背负了谋杀罪名。”

Please inform Mr. Gibson that I’ll see him tomorrow morning.

> “请转告吉布森先生，我明早去见他。”

The process for Miss Dunbar’s defense can also begin now."

> “帮邓巴小姐辩护的程序也可以走起来了。”

That evening, as we sat in the village inn smoking, Holmes gave a brief review of the case.

> “当晚，我们坐在乡村旅馆里抽烟，福尔摩斯简单回顾了案情。”

"Watson," he said,

> “华生，”他说，

"If you add the mystery of Thor Bridge to your collection of stories, it won’t enhance my so-called reputation.

> “如果把雷神桥谜案加入你的故事集，并不会提升我那所谓的美誉度。”

My mind was too sluggish, lacking the ability to combine imagination with reality, which is the foundation of detective work."

> “我脑子太迟钝，缺乏想象和现实相结合的能力，这可是探案技艺的基础啊。”

"To be frank, the notch on the stone railing alone was enough to reveal the truth. I can only blame myself for not grasping this clue earlier.

> “坦白说，石护栏上的缺口足以揭露真相，怪我自己没能尽早抓住这条线索。”

"I must admit, the thoughts of this unfortunate woman were indeed hidden and ingenious.

> “不得不承认，这个不幸女人的想法确实很隐秘、很巧妙。”

Uncovering her secret was no easy task.

> “想识破她的秘密并不容易。”

We’ve investigated countless cases and seen how destructive twisted love can be, but this one is by far the strangest.

> “我们探案无数，见识过扭曲的爱有多大的杀伤力，要数这次的案例最为离奇。”

Both spiritually and physically, Miss Dunbar was an unforgivable rival in her eyes.

> “不管是精神上还是肉体上，邓巴小姐在她眼里都是不可饶恕的情敌。”

Her husband’s rough treatment and harsh words, his rejection of her passionate love—all of this she clearly blamed on that innocent lady.

> “丈夫对她态度粗暴、恶语相向，排斥她热烈的感情，她显然把这一切都怪罪到那位无辜的女士身上。”

Her first thought was to commit suicide, but then she conceived a special kind of death that would subject her rival to a fate worse than death."

> “她的第一个念头就是自杀，后来想到一种特殊的死法，能把情敌置于比死亡更痛苦的境地。”

"We can clearly reconstruct her every step, each one showcasing her cunning.

> “我们能清楚地还原她的每一步，每一步都能看出她的手段高明。”

She cleverly obtained the note Miss Dunbar wrote.

> “她设法弄到邓巴小姐写的字条，非常聪明。”

It made it appear as though Miss Dunbar had chosen the crime scene herself.

> “看起来好像是邓巴小姐选择的作案地点。”

But she was so eager for the note to be discovered that she died clutching it, overdoing the disguise.

> “不过她太想让人发现字条了，到死还攥在手里，反倒伪装过了头。”

This alone should have raised suspicion, but unfortunately, I didn’t realize it sooner."

> “光这一点就应该引起怀疑，可惜我没能早一点意识到。”

"You saw it yourself—they have a lot of firearms in their house.

> “你也看见了，他们家的枪支不少。”

She took one of her husband’s guns and kept it for herself, along with a matching one.

> “她拿了丈夫的一把枪，留着自己用，还有一把相同的。”

She fired one shot in the woods earlier, which didn’t attract any attention, and then hid the second gun in Miss Dunbar’s wardrobe that morning.

> “她先带到树林放了一枪，没有引起任何人注意，然后在当天上午藏进了邓巴小姐的衣柜。”

She went to the bridge, already having devised an ingenious way to dispose of the revolver.

> “她去了石桥，事先已经想好绝妙的办法处理掉手枪。”

When Miss Dunbar arrived, she used the last of her strength to pour out her hatred.

> “邓巴小姐一到，她用生命最后的力量宣泄了自己的愤恨。”

Once Miss Dunbar had run far enough to be out of earshot, she carried out the most horrifying step."

> “等邓巴小姐跑到听不见枪声的地方，她完成了最可怕的一步。”

"Every link in the chain was in place, creating a complete sequence of events.

> “每一环节都已到位，形成了完整的事件链。”

The newspapers might ask why we didn’t search the lake earlier.

> “报纸上也许会问，为什么不一开始就到湖里捞一捞。”

It’s easy to criticize in hindsight. Such a large reed-filled lake isn’t somewhere you can just start dredging without a clear target—knowing what to look for and where to look.

> “马后炮的议论当然容易，这么大个芦苇湖可不是说捞就捞的，除非有明确的目标，知道要捞什么、在哪儿捞。”

Well, Watson, we’ve helped an extraordinary woman and a powerful man.

> “好了，华生，我们帮了一个出众的女人，也帮了一个强大的男人。”

In time, they might even come together—it’s not impossible.

> “他们以后说不定会走到一起，这种事也不是不可能。”

If that happens, the financial world will see that Mr. Neil Gibson has learned some important life lessons from this sorrowful chapter."

> “到时候金融界会发现，尼尔·吉布森先生经过悲伤一课，学到了不少人生教训。”
