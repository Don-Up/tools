I want to select some typical cases to showcase my friend Holmes's extraordinary intelligence, trying to pick those that are not so sensational yet allow him to fully display his talents.

> 我想选一些典型案例，展现我的朋友福尔摩斯的非凡才智，尽量挑选不那么骇人听闻却又让他能充分发挥才能的案子。

Unfortunately, the sensational and criminal acts cannot be completely separated, and I, as the recorder, often find myself in a dilemma.

> 可惜的是，骇人听闻和犯罪行为不可能完全分隔，我这个记录者常常陷入两难境地。

Either I sacrifice some details that are essential to the story, causing the case to lose its true face, or I have no choice but to write whatever comes my way without selection.

> 要么牺牲个别细节，而这些细节对故事来说又必不可少，导致案子失去了真实的面目，要么只能不加挑选，遇上什么写什么。

After a few simple and verbose words, let's get down to the business and tell a series of strange events, which are not short of particularly thrilling plots.

> 简单啰唆了几句，下面言归正传，讲述一连串离奇事件，当中不乏特别惊悚的情节。

It was an August day, with the weather being hot.

> 八月的一天，天气炎热。

Baker Street was like an oven, with the scorching sunlight shining on the yellow brick houses across the street, hurting people's eyes.

> 贝克街像烤箱，炽烈的阳光照射着对街的黄砖房屋，刺得人眼睛生疼。

It's hard to imagine that the same brick walls would be faint and dim in the winter fog.

> 很难想象，同样的砖墙，在冬天的迷雾中却若隐若现，那么暗淡。

The room's curtains were half open, and Holmes was lying curled up on the sofa, reading a letter he had received in the morning over and over again.

> 房间窗帘半开着，福尔摩斯蜷身躺在沙发上，一遍又一遍读着早上收到的一封信。

Having served in India, I obviously have a much stronger heat resistance than cold resistance, and ninety Fahrenheit degrees is nothing at all.

> 我在印度服过兵役，抗热能力明显强于抗寒能力，九十华氏度根本不算什么。

The newspaper was boring to read, the parliament had already adjourned, everyone had left the city for vacation, and I also longed for the forest clearings of the New Forest and the pebble beaches of the South Sea.

> 报纸读起来没劲，议会已经闭会，所有人都出城度假了，我也向往新森林的林中空地、南海的卵石海滩。

Unfortunately, my limited funds forced me to postpone my vacation.

> 可惜资金有限，不得不推迟假期。

As for my friend, he is not interested in the countryside or the beach at all. He just wants to lurk in the center of the five million population, extend his tentacles to them, and get into every crack.

> 至于我这位朋友，他对乡村、海滩统统不感兴趣，只想潜伏在五百万人口的中心地带，向他们伸展触须，钻进每一个缝隙。

Even the slightest whiff of a mystery case can be quickly sensed by him.

> 哪怕有一点点悬案的气息，都能迅速感应。

He has many talents, but appreciating natural scenery is definitely not among them.

> 他拥有众多才能，但欣赏自然风光绝不在其中。

Unless the background of the case shifts from the city to the countryside, he won't change the venue.

> 除非案子的背景从城市转移到乡村，他才会跟着变换场地。

Holmes was intently looking at the letter without any intention of speaking.

> 福尔摩斯专注地看着信，没有说话的意思。

I threw the boring newspaper aside, leaned back in the chair, and fell into a reverie.

> 我把枯燥的报纸扔到一旁，背靠椅子，陷入沉思。

Suddenly, my companion's voice interrupted my train of thought.

> 突然，同伴的声音打断了我的思路。

" Watson, you are right in thinking that solving disputes through war is indeed absurd," he said.

> “华生，你想得对，用战争解决争端，确实荒唐。”他说。

"How absurd!" I exclaimed in agreement, immediately realizing that he was conversing with my inner thoughts.

> “太荒唐了！”我激动地表示赞成，立刻意识到他是在跟我心里的想法对话。

I sat up straight and stared at him in amazement.

> 我坐直身子，惊讶地盯着他。

"How did you do that, Holmes?" I cried, "It's incredible!"

> “怎么办到的，福尔摩斯？”我叫道，“难以置信！”

Seeing my bewildered expression, he burst into laughter.

> 他看我一脸茫然，放声大笑。

"Do you remember," he said, "not long ago, I read to you a short story by Edgar Allan Poe, in which there was a meticulous reasoner who could discern his companion's inner thoughts? You thought it was just the author's rich imagination. I said I could do it too, but you didn't believe me at that time."

> “记得吗，”他说，“不久前，我给你读过埃德加·爱伦·坡的小故事，里面有个思维缜密的推理家，能够看出同伴的内心想法？你认为只是作者的丰富想象，我说我也能办到，你当时表示不相信。”

"Ah, I never said I didn't believe it!"

> “啊，我可没说不信！”

"My dear Watson, although you didn't say it with your mouth, it was all revealed in your expression. You just threw down the newspaper and fell into a reverie. I saw my chance and decided to explore what you were thinking, have a deep conversation with your inner self, and prove that we are truly like-minded friends."

> “亲爱的华生，你虽然嘴上没说，眉宇间全表露出来了。你刚才扔下报纸，陷入沉思，我一看机会来了，正好研究研究你在想什么，跟你的内心做一次深入交流，证明我们是心灵相通的好朋友。”

I was not satisfied with his explanation and said, "The example you read to me, the reasoner concluded by observing his companion's actions. If I remember correctly, the man tripped over a pile of stones and looked up at the stars, among other things. But I was just sitting still in the chair. What clues could I have given you?"

> 我对他的解释并不满意，说：“你给我读的那个例子，推理家是通过观察同伴的动作得出结论的。没记错的话，那人被一堆石头绊倒，抬头看星星，等等。可我只是一动不动坐在椅子上，能给你什么线索？”

"You underestimate yourself. The human senses are tools for expressing emotions, and yours have done a very good job of it."

> “你太小瞧自己了。人类的五官是表达感情的工具，而你的五官非常成功地完成了这一任务。”

"You mean you saw through my thoughts by observing my senses?"

> “你的意思是，通过我的五官看出了我的想法？”

"Yes, the senses, especially the eyes. You probably don't even remember how you started thinking, do you?"

> “对，五官，特别是眼睛。可能连你自己也不记得是怎么开始思考的吧？”

"Not at all."

> “完全不记得。”

"Let me tell you. You threw down the newspaper, which caught my attention, and then sat there expressionless for half a minute. Next, your gaze fell on the newly framed portrait of General Gordon, and your expression changed. I knew you had started thinking, but this line of thought didn't go far. Your eyes shifted to the side, staring at the portrait of Henry Ward Beecher, which was not yet framed and placed on a pile of books. Then you glanced at the wall, and the meaning was very clear. You were thinking that once this portrait is also framed, it would perfectly match the space on the wall, corresponding to the Gordon portrait over there."

> “让我来告诉你。你扔掉报纸，这个动作引起我的注意，然后面无表情地呆坐了半分钟。接着，你的视线落在新装裱的戈登将军画像上，表情起了变化，我知道你开始思考了，但是这条思路并没有走太远。你的眼睛转到旁边，盯着亨利·沃德·比彻的画像，画像还未装裱，放在书堆上。接着，你往墙上扫了一眼，意思很明显。你在想，等这幅画也裱好了，正好挂在墙上空白处，和那边的戈登画像对应。”

"You've seen right through me!" I exclaimed in amazement.

> “全被你看穿了！”我惊叹道。

At this point, it’s not yet a case of misjudgment.

> 到这一步还不至于看走眼。

Next, your thoughts returned to Beecher, and you stared intently at the portrait, as if studying his facial features.

> 接下来，思绪又回到比彻身上，你紧盯着画像，像是在研究他的相貌特征。

Gradually, your eyes relaxed, but they never left the painting, and your face took on a thoughtful expression, as if recalling Beecher’s life story.

> 渐渐地，眼睛放松下来，但始终没离开那张画，脸上一副若有所思的样子，是在回忆比彻一生的经历。

I knew you would surely remember his contributions to the North during the Civil War, and how you had once been outraged by the disrespect shown to him by British thugs.

> 我知道你一定会想起他在内战时替北方立下的功劳，记得你曾因为英国暴徒对他的无礼而愤慨不已。

Your reaction was so strong that now, as you recalled his life, it was impossible not to think of that experience.

> 反应那么强烈，现在回忆起他的人生，不可能不想到那段经历。

After a while, I noticed your gaze shifted away from the portrait, perhaps turning to thoughts of the Civil War.

> 过了一会儿，我发现你的视线离开了画像，也许思绪转到了内战上。

Your lips were tightly pressed, your eyes shone, and your fists were clenched. I was certain you were indeed thinking of the Civil War, of the brave struggles on the merciless battlefield.

> 你嘴唇紧闭、两眼放光、双手握拳，我敢肯定你确实在想内战，想到双方在无情战场上的英勇拼杀。

The expression on your face grew increasingly solemn, and you shook your head, surely thinking of the tragedy, horror, and innocent lives lost in the war.

> 你脸上的表情越来越凝重，还摇了摇头，一定是想到了战争的悲惨、恐怖和无辜牺牲的生命。

You reached out to touch your old wound, and a faint smile appeared on your trembling lips, clearly saying that resolving international disputes through war was absurd.

> 你伸手摸向自己的旧伤口，颤抖的嘴角挤出一点笑意，分明是在说，用战争的方式解决国际争端，太荒唐了。

Just as you thought of this, I spoke up in agreement, proving my reasoning to be entirely correct.

> 你刚想到这里，我出声赞同，结果证实我的推理完全正确。

“Exactly!” I said.

> “一点没错！”我说。

“Your explanation makes it even more impressive.”

> “经你一解释，更让人叹服了。”

“My dear Watson, these are just superficial observations.

> “亲爱的华生，这些都是皮毛而已。

If it weren’t for your skepticism that day, I wouldn’t have deliberately interrupted your train of thought.

> 要不是你那天表示怀疑，我才不会故意打断你的思路。

I have a small case at hand, and solving it is far more challenging than this little attempt at mind-reading.

> 我手头有个小案子，比起读心术的小小尝试，破案要难得多。

Miss Cushing of Cross Street, Croydon, received a package from the post office containing something quite shocking.

> 克罗伊登区十字街的库欣小姐收到邮局包裹，里面的东西相当惊人。

Did you notice the brief report in the newspaper?”

> 报上有简短报道，注意到了吗？

“No, I didn’t see it.”

> “没，没看到。”

“Ah! You must have missed it.

> “啊！一定是漏看了。

Throw the newspaper to me.

> 报纸扔给我。

It’s right here, under the financial section.

> 就在这儿，金融栏下面。

Please read it aloud.”

> 麻烦大声念一遍。

He tossed the newspaper over, and I picked it up, reading the report he mentioned, titled “The Gruesome Package”:

> 他又把报纸扔过来，我拿起来，念出他说的那篇报道，标题是《恐怖包裹》。

Miss Susan Cushing of Cross Street, Croydon, recently encountered a strange incident, which, if not linked to a crime, is undoubtedly a very cruel prank.

> 苏珊·库欣小姐家住克罗伊登区十字街，她最近遭遇了怪事，如果查出这跟犯罪无关，无疑是一场非常过分的恶作剧。

Yesterday afternoon at two o’clock, a postman delivered a small package wrapped in brown paper, containing a cardboard box filled with coarse salt.

> 昨天下午两点，邮递员送来一个小包裹，牛皮纸包装，里面是个硬纸盒，盒子里装满粗盐。

When Miss Cushing emptied the box, she was horrified to find two human ears, apparently freshly severed, within the salt.

> 库欣小姐倒空盒子，当场吓呆了，粗盐中有两只人耳，显然是刚割下来的。

The package was posted from Belfast yesterday morning, with no sender information.

> 邮包昨天早上从贝尔法斯特寄出，没有寄件人信息。

Miss Cushing, in her fifties, unmarried, lives a reclusive life with few friends and little correspondence, making the receipt of such a package even more mysterious.

> 库欣小姐五十来岁，没结过婚，过着与世隔绝的生活，基本没有朋友和信件来往，从邮局收到东西实属难得，这又给事件蒙上了一层神秘色彩。

A few years ago, Miss Cushing lived in Penge and rented a spare room to three young medical students.

> 几年前，库欣小姐住在彭吉区，曾把空余房间租给三个年轻的医学生。

They were too noisy and irregular in their habits, so she had to ask them to leave.

> 他们太过吵闹，作息也不规律，她不得不让他们搬走。

The police believe that the malicious act against Miss Cushing is likely the “handiwork” of these young men.

> 警方认为，库欣小姐遭遇的恶劣行为很可能是这几个年轻人的“杰作”。

They have held a grudge and wanted to frighten her, sending her some remains from the dissection room.

> 他们一直怀恨在心，想吓唬她，从解剖室弄了些残体寄过去。

Another point supporting this theory is that one of the students was from Northern Ireland, specifically Belfast, as far as Miss Cushing knows.

> 另有一点也支持这种推测，其中一个学生来自爱尔兰北部，据库欣小姐所知，正是贝尔法斯特。

The case is currently under active investigation, led by Inspector Lestrade, one of the city’s top detectives.

> 目前，本案正在积极调查中，由全城数一数二的警探莱斯特雷德先生负责。

When I finished reading, Holmes said, “That’s all from the Daily Chronicle.

> 我念完，福尔摩斯说：“《每日纪事报》就到这里。

Now it’s our friend Lestrade’s turn.

> 接下来轮到我们的朋友莱斯特雷德了。

I received a letter from him this morning, in which he said: ‘I think this case is right up your alley.

> 今早收到他的来信，信中说：我觉得这案子你最拿手。

The police are working hard on it, but there is indeed a difficulty—there are no clues to be found.

> 警方正在全力侦办，但确实有一点困难，找不到任何线索。

Of course, we’ve telegraphed the Belfast post office, but the number of packages sent that day was enormous, making it impossible to trace this particular one, and no one remembers the sender’s appearance.

> 贝尔法斯特邮局那边当然发电报问过了，可是当天交寄的邮包数量极多，无法追查到这一个邮包的信息，也不记得寄件人的样子。

The cardboard box is from a half-pound package of Melrose tobacco, which gives us no useful leads.

> 硬纸盒是蜜露调味烟草的包装盒，半磅装的，对我们毫无提示。

In my opinion, the theory about the medical students remains the most plausible.

> 在我看来，有关医学生的推测仍是最合理的。

I’d appreciate it if you could spare a few hours to come over.

> 还是麻烦你抽出几小时，过来一趟。

I won’t be here today, but at the police station.’”

> 今天一天我不在这里，就在警局。

“What do you say, Watson? Would you like to brave the heat and come with me to Croydon? It might be a case worth adding to your collection of stories.”

> “你说呢，华生？愿意顶着炎热跟我去趟克罗伊登区吗？说不定是个能写进故事集的案子。”

“I’d be glad to have something to do.”

> “我巴不得找点事做。”

“That’s perfect. Ring for the servant to prepare our boots and call a carriage. I’ll change out of my dressing gown, fill my tobacco box, and be back shortly.”

> “那正好。拉铃让用人准备靴子、叫马车。我去换掉睡袍，装满烟盒，一会儿就回来。”

We boarded the train, and a rain shower along the way made Croydon less stiflingly hot than the city.

> 我们坐上火车，路上下了阵雨，克罗伊登不像城里那么酷热难耐。

Holmes had sent a telegram ahead, and Lestrade met us at the station.

> 福尔摩斯提前发了电报，莱斯特雷德在车站接我们。

He was the same as ever—lean, alert, and looking like a ferret.

> 他还是老样子，身材精瘦，神情警觉，看着像雪貂。

After a five-minute walk, we arrived at Cross Street, where Miss Cushing lived.

> 我们步行五分钟，到了库欣小姐住的十字街。

The street was long, lined with neat two-story brick houses, their stone steps worn white, and groups of apron-clad women chatting at their doors.

> 街道很长，沿路是两层的砖房，干净整齐，石阶踩得白亮，系着围裙的女人三三两两在门口闲聊。

Halfway down, Lestrade stopped and knocked on a door, which was opened by a young maid who led us into the front room.

> 走到一半，莱斯特雷德停下来敲门，一个小女佣开门，带我们进了前厅。

Miss Cushing sat there, her face calm, her large eyes gentle, with curly gray hair framing her forehead.

> 库欣小姐坐在里面，面容平静，大眼睛透着温和，花白的卷发垂在额头两边。

She had a chair cover she was embroidering on her lap and a basket of colored threads on a stool beside her.

> 腿上放着正在绣的椅罩，身旁凳子上有一篮彩色丝线。

As soon as Lestrade entered, she said, “Those dreadful things are in the outhouse. I hope you’ll take them all away.”

> 莱斯特雷德一进屋她就说：“那些吓人的东西在外屋，希望你都拿走。”

“We will, Miss Cushing. They’ve been left here so my friend Mr. Holmes can examine them in your presence.”

> “会的，库欣小姐，之所以留在这儿，是想让我朋友福尔摩斯先生当着你的面看看。”

“Why in my presence, sir?”

> “为什么要当着我的面，先生？”

“So he can ask you questions.”

> “方便他向你提问。”
