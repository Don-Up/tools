# 黑彼得
### 1
"In 1895, it can be said that it was a year of explosive mental and physical activity for my friend.

> 1895年，可以说是我朋友脑力、体力大爆发的一年。

His fame grew, and the cases coming to him increased.

> 他名气越来越大，找上门来的案子越来越多。

Many prominent figures visited our humble Baker Street apartment,

> 许多声名显赫的人物光临了简陋的贝克街公寓，

some of whom were too sensitive to be publicly identified, even hinting at their identities felt inappropriate.

> 其中一些客户的身份不便公开，就连稍作暗示也会觉得有失体统。

Like all great artists, Holmes worked for the sake of art;

> 福尔摩斯像所有伟大的艺术家一样，为艺术而艺术，

the services he provided were valuable, but apart from the Holdeness Duke case,

> 他提供的服务价值不菲，但除了霍尔德尼斯公爵一案，

he rarely asked for high fees.

> 极少见他索取高额酬金。

He was so otherworldly and capricious that if a case did not interest him,

> 他就是这么不食人间烟火，这么任性，如果案子不对胃口，

even the most powerful and wealthy clients would be turned away.

> 即使再有权有钱的客户也会拒绝。

On the contrary, as long as a case was peculiar, full of drama, and challenged his intellect,

> 相反，只要案子奇特，充满戏剧色彩，能挑战智力，

he would spend weeks assisting even the humblest of clients.

> 即使再卑微的客户，他都会花上好几周时间大力相助。

In this unforgettable year, he tackled a series of uniquely styled bizarre cases,

> 在这难忘的一年里，他查办了一连串风格迥异的奇案，

such as the sensational case of the sudden death of Bishop Tosca,

> 比如轰动一时的托斯卡主教突然身亡案，

in which the Pope appointed Holmes to investigate.

> 教皇陛下钦点福尔摩斯负责调查；

He also sent the infamous bird trainer Wilson to prison,

> 他还把臭名远扬的驯鸟师威尔逊送进了大牢，

eliminating a menace in London's East End.

> 为伦敦东区消除了祸害。

Following these two high-profile cases was the tragic case at the Chopping Port Villa,

> 紧接着这两个著名案件，又发生了樵港别墅惨案，

where Captain Peter Carey died mysteriously.

> 彼得·凯里船长离奇死亡。

If this unique case is not documented, Holmes's collection of detective stories would be incomplete.

> 不把这个独特的案子写下来，福尔摩斯的探案故事集就算不上完整。

During the first week of July, my friend was often out,

> 七月的第一周，我朋友经常不在家，

and each time he left, he took a long time to return, indicating he was busy with a case.

> 每次出门都要很久才回来，看来手头有案子在忙。

During this time, several rough-looking men came seeking Captain Basil,

> 这段时间，有几个长相粗野的男人找上门，想见巴兹尔船长，

and I knew Holmes was once again investigating under a false identity.

> 我知道福尔摩斯又在用假身份查案。

He had countless disguises and aliases to conceal his formidable real identity;

> 他有无数种伪装、无数个化名，用来掩盖令人生畏的真实身份；

there were at least five temporary residences throughout London for him to play different roles.

> 在伦敦不同地方至少有五个临时住处，供他扮演不同角色。

He didn’t disclose what he was investigating, and I wasn’t accustomed to pressing him.

> 他没透露调查的是什么，我也不习惯逼他开口，

The first time he mentioned this case, his approach was quite unusual.

> 他第一次向我提到这个案子的时候，开场方式实在不同寻常。

That day he left before breakfast; just as I sat down to eat,

> 那天早饭前他就出门了，我刚坐下准备用餐，

he strode into the room, wearing a hat and holding a large harpoon under his arm,

> 他大踏步走进房间，头戴帽子，胳膊下夹着一根像雨伞一样的大鱼叉，

the tip of the harpoon had barbs.

> 叉头有倒刺。

"My God, Holmes!" I exclaimed, "You’re not really wandering around London with that thing, are you?"

> “天呐，福尔摩斯！”我叫道，​“你该不会带着这个东西在伦敦转悠吧？​”

"I went to the butcher's."

> “我坐车去了趟肉店。​”

"The butcher?"

> “肉店？​”

"I'm feeling quite hungry, dear Watson;

> “现在胃口大开，亲爱的华生，

exercise before meals is really beneficial for the body and mind.

> 饭前运动真是有益身心啊。

I bet you can’t guess what I did for exercise."

> 我敢打赌，你肯定猜不到我做了什么运动。​”

"I'd rather not guess."

> “我还是别猜了。​”

He laughed while pouring coffee.

> 他边笑边倒咖啡。

"Behind Aldridge's butcher shop, if you were present,

> “在阿勒代斯肉店后面，你要是亲临现场，

you would see a dead pig hanging from a hook in the roof,

> 会看见屋顶钩子上挂着一头死猪，

and a gentleman in a shirt was vigorously stabbing at it with this weapon.

> 一位身穿衬衣的先生正用这个武器使劲刺向它。

That energetic gentleman is me.

> 这位活力四射的先生就是本人。

The results were very satisfying; I only tried once and effortlessly pierced the dead pig.

> 结果非常满意，我只试了一下，就毫不费力刺穿了死猪。

Maybe you’d like to try?"

> 也许你也想试试？​”

"Not in the slightest. Why stab a pig?"

> “一点儿也不想。为什么刺死猪？​”

"I think it has an indirect relation to the Chopping Port Villa mystery case.

> “我觉得跟樵港别墅谜案有间接关系。

Ah, Hopkins, I received your telegram last night and was waiting for you.

> 啊，霍普金斯，昨晚收到你电报了，正等着你呢。

Come, let’s have breakfast together."

> 来，一起吃早饭。​”

The visitor, in his thirties, looked particularly alert, dressed in plain tweed,

> 来客三十来岁，模样格外机警，穿着素净的粗花呢便装，

but still retaining the erect posture of someone in official uniform.

> 但仍保持着穿官方制服时的挺拔姿态，我一眼认出是斯坦利·霍普金斯。

Holmes had high hopes for this young detective,

> 福尔摩斯对这位年轻警探寄予了厚望，

and the detective admired the famous amateur sleuth immensely,

> 而警探对这位知名业余侦探无比佩服，

worshipping his scientific methods of investigation like a schoolboy.

> 像小学生一样崇拜他的科学探案法。

Hopkins frowned and sat down dejectedly.

> 霍普金斯皱着眉头，垂头丧气地坐下。

"Thank you, but no, sir, I ate before coming.

> “谢谢，不用了，先生，来之前吃过了。

I came to London yesterday to report and stayed overnight in the city."

> 我昨天来伦敦汇报，在城里住了一晚。​”

"What was the report about?"

> “汇报什么？​”

"Failure, sir, a complete failure."

> “失败，先生，彻底的失败。​”

"Still no progress?"

> “还没进展？​”

"None."

> “没有。​”

"Tsk! I need to take a good look at this case."

> “啧啧！我得好好看看这个案子。​”

"That’s exactly what I desire, Mr. Holmes.

> “那我真是求之不得啊，福尔摩斯先生。

My first major case has hit a bottleneck; for God's sake, help me out."

> 我的第一个大案子就遭遇了瓶颈，看在上帝的分上，去给我帮帮忙吧。​”

"Alright, alright, I’ve already reviewed all the evidence, including the cause of death investigation report.

> “行，行，正好我已经研究完所有证据，包括死因调查报告。

By the way, a pipe was found at the crime scene;

> 对了，案发现场发现了一个烟袋，

how did the police explain that?

> 警方怎么解释？

Can you provide any clues?"

> 能提供一点线索吗？​”

Hopkins looked a bit surprised.

> 霍普金斯有些惊讶。

### 2
"It was just the deceased's own pipe, sir, with his initials inside, made of seal skin.

> “不过是死者自己的烟袋而已，先生，内里有他的名字缩写，而且是海豹皮做的，

He was particularly skilled at hunting seals."

> 他以前最擅长捕猎海豹。​”

"But he didn’t have a smoking pipe."

> “可他没有烟斗。​”

"Yes, sir, we did not find a pipe.

> “是的，先生，我们没找到烟斗。

He indeed did not smoke, but he might have kept tobacco to entertain friends."

> 他确实不抽烟，但有可能备着烟丝招待朋友。​”

"That's possible. I brought up the pipe because if I were investigating,

> “有可能。之所以提烟袋，是因为换作我来办案的话，

I would certainly use it as a starting point for my investigation.

> 肯定会以它作为调查的切入点。好了，我朋友华生医生还不了解案情，

Now, since my friend Dr. Watson is not familiar with the case,

> 我也愿意再听听案子的经过，请你大致介绍一下主要情况。​”

please give me a rough overview of the main situation."

> 霍普金斯从兜里掏出一张纸。

Hopkins pulled out a piece of paper.

> “我这里有一些日期，记录了死者彼得·凯里船长的经历。

"I have some dates here that record the experiences of the deceased, Captain Peter Carey.

> 1845年出生，现年五十岁。

Born in 1845, he is currently fifty years old.

> 以前是个成功的渔夫，胆子特别大，专门捕猎海豹和鲸鱼。

He was a successful fisherman, very bold, and specialized in hunting seals and whales.

> 1883年，在邓迪港当上了捕海豹汽船船长，船名‘独角海兽号’，

In 1883, he became the captain of a seal-hunting steamship named the "Unicorn".

> 连续成功出海数次。1884年退休。

He successfully sailed several times and retired in 1884.

> 到处旅游了几年，最后在苏塞克斯郡买下樵港别墅，

After traveling for a few years, he finally bought the Chopping Port Villa in Sussex,

> 地方不大，靠近森林路。

a modest place near Forest Road.

> 他在那里住了六年，一周前遇害。

He lived there for six years before he was murdered a week ago.

"This man had an extremely peculiar character.

> “这个人性格极其古怪。

He lived a rigid Puritan life, was taciturn, and often in low spirits.

> 平常过着刻板的清教徒生活，沉默寡言，整天情绪低落。

He had a wife, a twenty-year-old daughter, and two maids at home.

> 家里还有妻子、二十岁的女儿和两个女佣。

The atmosphere was so gloomy that it was sometimes unbearable,

> 因为气氛阴郁，有时简直让人无法忍受，

and the maids changed several times.

> 女佣换了好几拨。

He would often get drunk and become a devil when he did.

> 他动不动就喝个烂醉，一醉就成了魔鬼。

I heard that he once chased his wife and daughter out into the yard in the middle of the night,

> 听说大半夜把妻子和女儿赶到屋外，

beating them and waking the entire village with their screams."

> 满院子追着打，整个村子都被她们的尖叫声惊醒。

"The old parish priest went to his home to advise him to behave himself,

> “教区的老牧师去他家，劝他行为收敛点，

but ended up getting beaten up by him and finally went to court over it.

> 结果被他狠揍了一顿，最后还闹上了法庭。

In short, Mr. Holmes, it’s hard to find a more ferocious character than Peter Carey in this world.

> 总之，福尔摩斯先生，世上恐怕难找到像彼得·凯里这样凶悍的人物。

I also heard that his temper when he was captain was even worse than later;

> 我还听说，他当船长时的脾气比后来有过之无不及，

his peers called him 'Black Peter'.

> 同行都叫他‘黑彼得’。

This nickname was not just because of his dark appearance and thick black beard,

> 送他这个绰号不仅因为他长得黑，留着大黑胡子，

but also because his dark aura frightened those around him.

> 还因为他的暗黑气场让周围人胆战心惊。

Needless to say, the neighbors disliked him and avoided him,

> 不用说，邻居都讨厌他，都不跟他来往，

and no one mourned his tragic death, not even a little."

> 没人对他的惨死表示哀痛，哪怕一点点也没有。

"Mr. Holmes, you have seen the cause of death investigation report and should know that he had a small cabin,

> “福尔摩斯先生，你看过死因调查报告，应该知道他有个小木屋，

but your friend might not be aware of it.

> 不过你朋友可能还不知情。

The cabin is a few hundred yards from the villa,

> 木屋距离别墅几百码，

and he built it himself.

> 是他亲手盖的，

He habitually called it his 'cabin' and slept there every night.

> 他习惯叫它‘船舱’，每晚都在那里睡觉。

It’s just a small room, sixteen feet long and ten feet wide.

> 里面只是一个小房间，长十六英尺，宽十英尺。

He made his own bed and cleaned it himself,

> 他自己铺床，自己打扫，

and kept the key in his pocket, never allowing anyone to enter.

> 钥匙放在兜里随身带，不许任何人进入。

The cabin had small windows covered with curtains that he never opened.

> 木屋墙面有小窗户，拉着窗帘，从不打开。

One window faces the main road, and at night, passersby often pointed at the lit window, guessing what Black Peter was doing inside.

> 其中一扇朝向大路，到了晚上，路人经常指着亮灯的窗户，猜想黑彼得在里面做什么。

Mr. Holmes, the cause of death investigation report provides few solid pieces of evidence,

> 福尔摩斯先生，死因调查报告提供的确凿证据不多，

and one of them came from this window."

> 其中一条就来自这扇窗户。

"Do you remember? Two days before the murder, around one o'clock at midnight,

> “你记得吧，凶案发生前两天，子夜一点左右，

a stonemason named Slater was passing through the forest road,

> 有个叫斯莱特的石匠从森林路过来，

and he stopped by the cabin, looking at the window with the light in the bushes for a while.

> 经过木屋时停下，朝树丛中亮灯的方窗子看了一会儿。

He swore that there was a clear profile of a man's face casting a shadow on the curtain,

> 他发誓说，窗帘上有个男人的侧脸影子，非常清楚，

and it definitely wasn’t Peter Carey.

> 而且肯定不是彼得·凯里。

He was familiar with the captain's appearance,

> 他熟悉船长的长相，

and the person behind the curtain also had a beard, but it was short and straight, very different from the captain's.

> 窗帘上的人也留着胡子，但胡须短而直，跟船长的大不一样。

The stonemason seemed quite sure,

> 石匠说得相当有把握，

but he had been drinking at the tavern for two hours,

> 不过他在酒馆喝了两小时酒，

and there was some distance between the road and the window.

> 大路和窗户之间也有段距离。

Besides, he was talking about Monday, while the murder happened on Wednesday."

> 再说了，他说的是周一的事，凶案是周三发生的。

### 3
"On Tuesday, Peter Carey was particularly gloomy, his face red from drinking,

> “周二，彼得·凯里心情格外阴沉，喝得满脸通红，

fierce like a dangerous beast.

> 像危险的野兽一样凶猛。

He ran around the house, and the women, hearing him approach, hid in fright.

> 他在屋里乱跑，女人们听见他靠近，吓得到处躲。

In the middle of the night, he returned to the cabin.

> 深夜，他回到小木屋。

His daughter left the window open while sleeping,

> 他女儿睡觉没关窗，

and around two o'clock the next morning, she heard a terrifying scream from the direction of the cabin.

> 第二天深夜两点左右，听见木屋方向传来一声恐怖的叫喊。

It was common for him to shout loudly when drunk, so she didn’t think much of it.

> 他喝醉了大喊大叫是常有的事，女儿也就没放心上。

At seven, a maid got up and found the cabin door open.

> 七点，一个女佣起床，发现木屋门开着。

Everyone was afraid of him and didn’t dare check until noon.

> 大家都害怕他，直到中午才敢过去看怎么回事。

Seeing the scene through the open door, her face turned pale, and she ran to the village.

> 从敞开的屋门看到里面的场景，她们顿时脸色煞白，飞奔到村里。

Within an hour, I arrived at the scene and took over the case.

> 不出一小时，我赶到现场，接手了这个案子。

"Mr. Holmes, you know I’m not easily scared, but to be honest,

> “福尔摩斯先生，你是知道的，我这人胆子不算小，可是说实话，

the moment I stepped into the cabin, I trembled with fear.

> 踏进小木屋那一刻，我吓得浑身一哆嗦。

The room was filled with flies and greenbottles buzzing like an organ;

> 满屋子家蝇、绿头蝇乱飞，像风琴嗡嗡直响；

the walls and floor looked like a slaughterhouse.

> 墙上、地上仿佛屠宰场。

The captain called it a 'cabin'; it truly felt like being on a ship.

> 船长叫它‘船舱’，确实是个船舱，身在其中就像上了船。

Inside, there were sailor's storage boxes, maps, nautical charts, and a photo of the 'Unicorn'.

> 屋里有水手储物箱、地图、航海图、‘独角海兽号’照片，

On a shelf, there was a row of logbooks, and a bed at one end—

> 架子上一排航海日志，一头有个床铺，

everything was typical of a captain's quarters.

> 一切都是典型的船长室配置。

The captain himself was there, in the middle of the cabin,

> 船长本人就在那儿，就在木屋中央，

his face twisted like a demon tortured in hell,

> 面目扭曲，像是地狱中煎熬的恶鬼，

his white beard bristling from extreme pain.

> 因为极度痛苦，花白的大胡子也翘了起来。

A steel harpoon pierced his broad chest, deeply embedded in the wooden wall behind him,

> 一根钢制鱼叉直穿宽阔的胸膛，深深扎进背后的木墙，

making him look like a beetle pinned to a piece of cardboard.

> 他就像钉在硬纸板上的小甲虫。

Without thinking, he was already dead, having emitted a final scream of pain.

> 想都不用想，他早死了，断气前发出了最后一声痛苦的叫喊。

"I understand your methods, sir, and I applied them.

> “我了解你的探案方法，先生，也用到了。

I didn’t move anything and meticulously examined the ground inside and outside the cabin;

> 我没移动任何东西，非常仔细地检查了屋里屋外的地面，

there were no footprints."

> 没有脚印。​”

"To be precise, you didn't see any footprints."

> “准确说，是你没看到脚印。​”

"I assure you, sir, there were none."

> “我保证，先生，真没有。​”

"Dear Hopkins, I’ve investigated countless cases,

> “亲爱的霍普金斯，我查案无数，

and I’ve never encountered a criminal who could commit a crime without leaving traces.

> 还从没见过飞行作案的犯罪分子。

As long as a criminal walks on foot, there will be some indentations, smudges,

> 只要罪犯靠腿走路，肯定会留下一点凹痕、擦痕或者微小的移动痕迹，

or minor signs of movement that cannot escape a keen observer’s eye.

> 或者微小的移动痕迹，逃不过观察高手的眼睛。

In such a blood-stained room, there’s not a single usable trace—it’s truly unbelievable.

> 这样一个血迹斑斑的房间，竟没有一点可以利用的痕迹，实在难以置信。

However, from the cause of death investigation report, certain things did indeed escape your keen eye."

> 不过，从死因调查报告看，有些东西确实没逃过你的慧眼。​”

Hearing my friend's sarcasm, the young detective felt somewhat embarrassed.

> 听我朋友一番讽刺，年轻的警探有些尴尬。

"Mr. Holmes, it was my mistake not to consult you immediately;

> “福尔摩斯先生，是我失策，没有第一时间向你请教，

now it's too late to regret.

> 现在后悔来不及了。

Indeed, there were things in the room that caught the police’s attention.

> 没错，房间里确实有些东西引起了警方注意。

For example, the harpoon used as the murder weapon was taken from a shelf on the wall,

> 比如用作凶器的鱼叉，是从墙上架子上抓下来的，

and there were two others on the shelf, with a third one missing.

> 架上还有两根，第三根的位置空了，

The handle of the harpoon was engraved with 'Dundee Port, Unicorn Steamship'.

> 叉柄上刻着‘邓迪港，独角海兽号汽船’。

From this, we can infer that the murderer may have acted out of rage, grabbing the nearest weapon.

> 由此推测，凶手可能是一怒之下起了杀心，顺手抓起最近的武器。

The time of the murder was around two o'clock in the morning,

> 案发时间是深夜两点，

and Peter Carey was dressed neatly, indicating he had arranged to meet the murderer.

> 而彼得·凯里穿着整齐，说明他和凶手约好了见面。

On the table, there was a bottle of rum and two used cups, further proving this point."

> 桌上有瓶朗姆酒、两个用过的杯子，进一步证明了这一点。​”

"Yes," Holmes said, "both deductions make sense.

> “是的，”福尔摩斯说，​“两个推测都有道理。

Besides the rum, was there any other alcohol in the room?"

> 除了朗姆酒，房间还有其他酒吗？​”

"Yes, there’s brandy in the cabinet and whiskey on the sailor's box.

> “有，酒柜有白兰地，水手箱上有威士忌。

These bottles are full and clearly haven’t been touched, so they’re not important to the case."

> 这些酒瓶都是满的，显然没喝过，对案子来说不重要。​”

"Not necessarily; the existence of these bottles is significant in itself," Holmes said.

> “不一定，这些酒的存在本身就有意义，​”福尔摩斯说，

"Now, continue discussing what you think is important."

> “好了，继续说说你觉得重要的东西。​”

"The pipe I mentioned earlier is on the table."

> “刚才提到的烟袋在桌上。​”

"Which part of the table?"

> “桌上哪个位置？​”

"Right in the center. The bag is made of hairy seal skin,

> “正中央。袋子是带毛的海豹皮做的，

the leather is coarse, secured with a leather cord,

> 皮质粗糙，袋口用皮绳捆住，

and the inside of the flap has the initials 'P.C.' along with half an ounce of strong tobacco,

> 口盖内里有‘P.C.\[插图\]’字样，里面装着半盎司烟丝，是船员常抽的劲道很大的那种。

the kind that crew members commonly smoke."

> ​”

"Excellent! What else?"

> “好极了！还有呢？​”

Hopkins pulled out a notebook from his pocket,

> 霍普金斯从兜里掏出一个记事本，

the brown cover worn and rough, with faded paper.

> 土褐色外皮磨损得毛毛糙糙，纸张也褪了色。

The first page had the initials "J.H.N." and the year "1883".

> 第页写着姓名首字母“J.H.N.”和年份“1883”。

Holmes placed it on the table and began to examine it carefully,

> 福尔摩斯把它放桌上，开始仔细检查，

while Hopkins and I stood on either side, peering over his shoulder.

> 我和霍普金斯分站他身后两边，越过肩膀看过去。

The second page had the printed letters "C.P.R.",

> 第二页有印刷体字母“C.P.R.”，

followed by several pages of numbers.

> 然后连续几页都是数字。

Further back, there were headings like "Argentina", "Costa Rica", and "São Paulo",

> 再后面有“阿根廷”“哥斯达黎加”“圣保罗”几个标题，

each followed by several pages of symbols and numbers.

> 每个标题之后也是连续几页符号和数字。

"What do you think this is?" Holmes asked.

> “你觉得这是什么？​”福尔摩斯问。

"It looks like a record of securities transactions.

> “好像是证券交易的明细。

I believe 'J.H.N.' is the initials of a stockbroker, and 'C.P.R.' might be his client."

> 我认为‘J.H.N.’是证券经纪人的名字缩写，‘C.P.R.’可能是他的客户。​”

"It should be the Canadian Pacific Railway."

> “应该是加拿大太平洋铁路\[插图\]。”福尔摩斯说。

Hopkins thumped his thigh hard and cursed himself.

> 霍普金斯狠狠捶了一下大腿，咬着牙骂自己。

### 4
"I’m so stupid!" he exclaimed.

> “我真蠢！”他叫道，​

"Of course, it's your kind of explanation.

> “当然是你这种解释。

Next, we’re left with 'J.H.N.' I checked the stock exchange records,

> 接下来就剩‘J.H.N.’了，我查过证券交易所的档案，

and in 1883, there was no broker whose name matched,

> 1883年，不管场内场外的经纪人，没有谁的名字对得上，

but I still believe this is the most crucial clue we have so far.

> 但我始终认为这是目前掌握的最关键的线索。

I have to admit, Mr. Holmes, the initials likely belong to the second person at the scene,

> 不得不承认，福尔摩斯先生，名字缩写很可能是现场第二人的，

that is to say, the murderer.

> 也就是说，是凶手的。

Additionally, I want to emphasize that the notebook involved in the case contains a large number of securities,

> 另外，我还想强调一点，案子中出现的记事本涉及大量有价证券，

which finally provides us with a lead on the motive for the crime."

> 终于为我们提供了作案动机的线索。​”

Holmes's expression changed slightly, clearly surprised by this turn of events.

> 福尔摩斯脸色有些异样，看得出来，案情的转折完全出乎意料。

"I must admit, both points make sense," he said.

> “确实不得不承认，两点都有道理，​”他说，

"The cause of death investigation report didn't mention the notebook;

> “死因调查报告并没提到记事本，

to be frank, its appearance has changed my perspective on the case.

> 坦白说，它的出现改变了我对案子的看法。

I had a conclusion in mind, but unfortunately, I can’t explain the notebook.

> 本来想好了一个结论，可惜没法解释记事本。

Have you checked the securities recorded inside?"

> 里面记录的证券都查过了？​”

"The police are investigating.

> “警局正在查。

These places are all in South America, and the complete information of the securities holders should also be there,

> 这些地方都在南美，证券持有者的完整信息也应该在南美，

but it may take several weeks to get results."

> 恐怕得等上好几周才有结果。​”

Holmes examined the cover of the notebook with a magnifying glass.

> 福尔摩斯用放大镜检查记事本的封面。

"There’s a patch of a different color here."

> “这里有块颜色不一样。​”他说。

"Yes, sir, it's a bloodstain. The notebook was picked up off the floor."

> “对，先生，是血迹。本子是从地上捡的。​”

"Is the blood on the top or bottom of the notebook?"

> “血在本子上面还是下面？​”

"On the side that was on the floor."

> “贴着地板那面。​”

"This indicates it fell on the ground after the murder occurred."

> “说明是谋杀发生后掉地上的。​”

"Exactly, Mr. Holmes, I thought of that too.

> “没错，福尔摩斯先生，我也想到了，

It might have been dropped by the murderer in a hurried escape;

> 可能是凶手慌忙逃跑时掉的，

the location is next to the door."

> 位置在门旁边。​”

"There are no securities among the deceased's possessions, right?"

> “死者的财产里没有这些证券吧？​”

"None, sir."

> “没有，先生。​”

"Could it have been a robbery?"

> “有可能是抢劫吗？​”

"No, sir, nothing was disturbed in the room."

> “没有，先生，屋里什么东西都没动。​”

"Oh, how increasingly interesting!

> “哎呀，真是越来越有趣了。

There was a knife at the scene, right?"

> 现场有把刀，对吧？​”

"A sheathed knife, which wasn’t drawn, located by the corpse's feet.

> “带鞘刀，刀没拔出来，位置在尸体脚边，

Mrs. Carey recognized it as her husband's knife."

> 凯里太太认出那是丈夫的刀。​”

Holmes fell into deep thought, and after a while, he said,

> 福尔摩斯陷入了沉思，过了一会儿，说：​“嗯，看来我得亲自去现场看看。​”

Hopkins cheered.

> 霍普金斯一声欢呼。

"Thank you, sir, you’ve calmed my nerves."

> “谢谢，先生，你给我吃了定心丸。​”

Holmes waved his finger at the detective.

> 福尔摩斯朝警探摇摇手指。

"Had it been a week ago, the case would have been easier to handle,"

> “换作一周前，案子会好办些，​”他说，

"Of course, going now can still uncover something.

> “当然了，现在去也能查出点名堂。

Watson, you’re welcome to join if you have time.

> 华生，有时间欢迎一起去。

Hopkins, please call for a carriage; we’ll leave for Forest Road in a quarter of an hour."

> 霍普金斯，麻烦你叫车，一刻钟后出发去森林路。​”

We got off the train at a roadside station,

> 我们在路边小站下了火车，

then took a carriage for several miles through a vast forest site.

> 又坐了几英里马车，穿过一片广阔的森林遗址。

This area belonged to a famous forest region,

> 再说了，福尔摩斯先生，我想抓的人已经抓到了，

where is your strongman?"

> 你那位大力士在哪儿呢？​”

"He’s coming upstairs," Holmes said calmly.

> “上楼来了，​”福尔摩斯冷静地说，

"Watson, prepare the gun and keep it within easy reach."

> “华生，备好枪，放到方便拿的地方。​”

He stood up and placed a piece of paper with writing on it on the side table.

> 他站起来，把一张有字的纸放到墙边桌上，

"All set," he said.

> “万事俱备，​”他说。

### 8
"Outside, there was a rough voice, and Mrs. Hudson pushed the door open, saying three people were looking for Captain Basil."

> “外面传来粗哑的说话声，哈德森太太推开门，说有三个人找巴兹尔船长。”

"Let them in one by one," Holmes said.

> “让他们一个一个进来。​”福尔摩斯说。

The first to enter was a short man, looking like a Ribston apple, with flushed cheeks and a fluffy white beard.

> 最先进来的是个小个子，长得像里布斯顿苹果，脸颊通红，蓬松的络腮胡全白了。

Holmes pulled a letter from his pocket.

> 福尔摩斯从兜里掏出一封信。

"Name?" he asked.

> “名字？​”他问。

"James Lancaster."

> “詹姆斯·兰卡斯特。​”

"Sorry, Lancaster, the crew is full.

> “抱歉，兰卡斯特，人员已满。

Here’s half a guinea for the trouble.

> 这半镑金币给你，添麻烦了。

Please wait in that room for a few minutes."

> 请到那个房间稍等几分钟。​”

Next was a tall, thin man with sparse straight hair and a waxy complexion named Hugh Pattins.

> 接着是个干瘦的高个子，稀疏的直发，脸色蜡黄，名叫休·帕廷斯。

He was also rejected, took the half guinea, and went to wait in another room.

> 他也被拒绝了，拿了半镑金币，到另一房间等候。

The third applicant was unusual-looking, like a fierce bulldog, with messy hair and beard surrounding his face,

> 第三个应聘者长相不同寻常，像凶狠的斗牛犬，蓬乱的头发和胡子围着脸一圈，

and thick eyebrows drooping over his fierce black eyes.

> 浓密的眉毛往下垂，挡不住两只黑眼睛的凶光。

He stood at attention like a sailor, nervously fiddling with his hat.

> 他像船员一样敬礼站好，手里不停摆弄着帽子。

"Name?" Holmes asked.

> “名字？​”福尔摩斯问。

"Patrick Keynes."

> “帕特里克·凯恩斯。​”

"Harpooner?"

> “鱼叉手？​”

"Yes, sir, I've been to sea twenty-six times."

> “是的，先生，出海二十六次。​”

"Dundee port?"

> “邓迪港？​”

"That's right."

> “没错。​”

"Can you go on an expedition ship?"

> “探险船可以吗？​”

"Yes."

> “可以。​”

"What is your expected salary?"

> “期望薪酬？​”

"Eight pounds a month."

> “每月八英镑。​”

"Can you leave immediately?"

> “马上出发可以吗？​”

"I need to grab my luggage first."

> “我得先拿上行李。​”

"Do you have any identification?"

> “有证件吗？​”

"Yes, sir."

> “有，先生。​”

He pulled out a stack of old forms, greasy and tattered.

> 他从兜里掏出一沓满是油渍的旧表单，

Holmes glanced at them and returned them.

> 福尔摩斯匆匆扫了一眼还给他。

"You are exactly the person I’m looking for," he said.

> “你正是我要找的人，​”他说，

"The contract is on the side table; sign it, and we’re set."

> “合同在墙边桌上，签个名，这事就定了。​”

The crew member staggered across the room, picked up the pen, and leaned over the table, asking,

> 船员摇摇晃晃穿过房间，拿起笔，伏在桌上，问：​“签这里吗？​”

Holmes bent over him from behind, reaching his hands around his neck, saying,

> 福尔摩斯弯腰站他身后，双手伸过他脖子，说：​“这就行了。​”

I heard a metallic "click," followed by a roar, like an angry bull.

> 我听到金属“咔嗒”一响，紧接着是一声吼叫，好像愤怒的公牛。

In an instant, Holmes and the crew member were on the ground, wrestling with each other.

> 瞬时间，福尔摩斯和船员倒在地上，扭打在一起。

Despite Holmes's quick movements as he cuffed the crew member's hands,

> 尽管福尔摩斯动作快，铐住了船员的双手，

the opponent was incredibly strong.

> 但对方力大无比，

If it weren't for Hopkins and me rushing in to help,

> 要不是我和霍普金斯冲上去帮忙，

I fear my friend would not have been able to hold on.

> 我朋友恐怕招架不住。

Finally, I took out my gun, pressing the cold barrel against his temple,

> 最后我拿起枪，冰冷的枪口顶着他的太阳穴，

and only then did he realize that resistance was futile.

> 他这才意识到再怎么反抗也是徒劳。

We tied his ankles with rope and stood up, panting.

> 我们用绳子绑住他的脚踝，气喘吁吁站起来。

"Hopkins, I apologize," Holmes said,

> “霍普金斯，非常抱歉，​”福尔摩斯说，

"the scrambled eggs might have gone cold.

> “炒鸡蛋可能放凉了。

However, your case has finally come to a satisfactory conclusion.

> 不过，你的案子终于圆满收官了，

Thinking of this, whatever we eat next will be tasty."

> 想到这一点，接下来吃什么都有滋有味吧。​”

Hopkins was dumbfounded, his face turning red,

> 霍普金斯目瞪口呆，涨红了脸，

taking a long time to blurt out a few words.

> 半天才迸出几句话。

"Mr. Holmes, I don’t know what to say;

> “福尔摩斯先生，我不知道该说什么，

I feel like a complete fool.

> 看自己就像个彻头彻尾的傻瓜。

I shouldn't have forgotten that I am the student and you are the master;

> 我不该忘记，我是学生，你是大师，

now I finally realize it.

> 现在总算醒悟了。

I witnessed everything, yet I still don’t understand how you did it,

> 经过我都亲眼看见了，但还是不懂你是怎么办到的，

and what it all means."

> 一切都是什么意思。​”

"Alright, alright," Holmes said calmly.

> “好了，好了，​”福尔摩斯心平气和地说，

"We all learn from experience.

> “我们都是在经验中吸取教训。

Your lesson this time is to never overlook the second option.

> 你这次的教训是，永远不要忽视第二选项。

By fixating on Neligan,

> 死抱着内利根一棵树不放，

you naturally had no time to consider Patrick Keynes,

> 当然没心思关注帕特里克·凯恩斯，

the real murderer of Peter Carey."

> 谋杀彼得·凯里的真凶。​”

The crew member’s hoarse voice interrupted our conversation.

> 船员沙哑的声音打断了我们的谈话。

"Listen, sir," he said,

> “听好了，先生，​”他说，

"I have no words for such rough treatment,

> “受到这种粗暴对待，我没话说，

but please do not casually place accusations.

> 但请你不要随口安罪名。

You say I murdered Peter Carey;

> 你说我谋杀了彼得·凯里，

I say I killed Peter Carey;

> 我说我杀了彼得·凯里，

that is two different matters.

> 这完全是两码事。

Maybe you don't believe me and think I’m lying."

> 也许你不相信我，觉得我在编瞎话。​”

"Not at all," Holmes said.

> “没有的事，​”福尔摩斯说，

"Feel free to say what you want."

> “你想说什么尽管说。​”

"It can be summed up in a few words; I swear to God,

> “几句就能说完，我对天发誓，句句属实。

I know Black Peter well; when I saw him pull out a knife,

> 我对黑彼得这人我了解，看他拿出刀来，

I knew it was either him or me who would die,

> 我知道不是他死就是我亡，

so I grabbed the harpoon and stabbed him.

> 于是抓起鱼叉刺向了他。

That’s how he died; if you call it murder, I’ll accept it.

> 他就是这么死的，你要说是谋杀，我也认了。

In the end, death is death;

> 终归都是死，

I’d rather go to the gallows than let Black Peter's knife pierce my heart."

> 我宁愿上绞架，也不想让黑彼得的刀刺穿心脏。​

### 9
"How did you end up there?" Holmes asked.

> “你怎么会在那儿？​”福尔摩斯问。

"This requires a long story. Please help me sit up; it will be easier to talk."

> “这就得从头说起了。让我坐起来吧，说话容易些。”

"It happened in 1883, specifically in August.

> “事情发生在1883年，确切说是那年八月。

Peter Carey was the captain of the 'Sea Unicorn,' and I was the spare harpooner.

> 彼得·凯里是‘独角海兽号’船长，我是后备鱼叉手。

We were returning home, just exiting the pack ice, sailing against the wind.

> 我们当时在返航中，正驶出流冰带，一路逆风而行。

A strong wind from the south lasted a week, and a small sailboat was blown north, running into us.

> 南方刮来的大风持续了一周，有艘小帆船被吹到了北边，正好跟我们遇上。

There was only one person on board, who had no experience at sea.

> 船上只有一个人，没有一点出海经验。

The crew thought the boat would sink, and if they jumped into the lifeboat and headed for Norway,

> 船员们觉得船要沉，如果跳上救生艇朝挪威海岸去了，

I estimated he would drown in the end.

> 我估计最后就淹死了。

We brought the man on board, and the captain talked with him in the cabin for a long time.

> 我们把这个人救上船，船长和他在舱里聊了很长时间。

He only had a tin box with him.

> 他随身带上来的物品只有一个锡盒。

Nobody knew his name; I certainly didn't.

> 没人知道他叫什么，反正我不知道。

The next night, he disappeared, as if he had never been on the ship.

> 第二天晚上过后，他消失了，就像从没上过船一样。

Everyone speculated he either jumped overboard or accidentally fell in due to the bad weather.

> 大家猜测要么是他自己跳海了，要么是因为天气恶劣，他不小心掉下去了。

Only one person knew what happened, and that person was me.

> 只有一个人知道发生了什么，那个人就是我。

I was on the midnight watch and saw the captain grab him by the ankle and toss him overboard.

> 那天我值午夜班，亲眼看见船长抓住他的脚踝，把他掀过船舷。

I didn’t tell anyone, waiting to see how things developed.

> “我没对别人说这事，等着看后续发展。

Two days later, we saw the Shetland lighthouse.

> 两天后，我们看见了设得兰灯塔。

Back in Scotland, it was easy to cover everything up; nobody raised any questions.

> 回到苏格兰，事情很容易就掩盖过去了，没人提出任何质疑。

An unrelated person had died accidentally, and no one wanted to meddle.

> 一个不相干的人意外身亡，谁也不想多管闲事。

Soon after, Peter Carey retired, and it took me many years to find out where he was.

> 不久后，彼得·凯里退休了，过了很多年，我才找到他在哪儿。

I think he killed that man for what was in the tin box;

> 我想他是为了锡盒里的东西才狠下毒手，

I’ve kept this secret for so long, and now it’s time for him to pay me for my silence."

> 我保守秘密这么久，现在是时候让他交封口费了。

"A crew member saw him in London, and I found out his address, preparing to go and ask him for money.

> “有个船员在伦敦见过他，我打听到他的住址，准备过去敲他一笔。

The first night, he was quite nice, saying he would give me some money,

> 第一个晚上他态度还不错，说好给我一笔钱，

so I would never have to suffer at sea again.

> 永远不用再过海上的苦日子。

We agreed to meet again in two days to wrap everything up.

> 我们商定两天后再见一面，给整件事画上句号。

When I went a second time, I found him drunk and particularly irritable.

> 第二次去，我发现他喝得烂醉，脾气特别暴躁。

We sat down to drink together and talked about the past.

> 我们坐下来一起喝酒，聊起过去的事。

The more he drank, the more off his demeanor became.

> 他喝得越多，神情越不对劲。

I saw a harpoon on the wall and thought that if needed, I would have to use it for self-defense.

> 我看到了墙上的鱼叉，心想万一有需要，我得用它来防身。

In the end, he indeed exploded, cursing at me,

> 最后他果然爆发了，冲我一通唾骂，

his eyes filled with murderous rage, holding a large knife in its sheath.

> 眼里杀气腾腾，手里握着带鞘大刀，还没来得及拔出来，

Before he could draw it, I grabbed the harpoon and stabbed at him.

> 我抓起鱼叉刺了过去。

My God! His scream was terrifying!

> 我的天！他那声惨叫真够吓人的！

That face haunted my sleep.

> 那张脸搅得人睡不着觉。

I stood there as his blood splattered everywhere.

> 我站在那儿，他的血溅得到处都是。

After a while, when there was no movement around, I got braver,

> 等了一会儿，周围没什么动静了，我胆子又大了起来，

looking around and spotting the tin box on the shelf.

> 环视一圈，发现了架子上的锡盒。

If Peter Carey could take it, why couldn’t I?

> 彼得·凯里能拿，我为什么不能呢？

I took the tin box and left the cabin,

> 我拿上锡盒离开了木屋，

the biggest mistake being that I forgot my pipe on the table.

> 最失策的地方就是把烟袋忘在了桌上。

"Next, let me talk about the strangest thing.

> “接下来说说最奇怪的一件事。

As soon as I stepped out of the cabin, I heard someone coming and quickly hid in the bushes.

> 我刚踏出木屋，听见有人来了，赶紧躲进树丛。

A man sneaked over, entered the cabin, and let out a scream as if he had seen a ghost,

> 一个男人偷偷摸摸走过来，进了木屋，跟撞见鬼似地惊叫一声，

then bolted out, disappearing in a flash.

> 拼命冲出来，一溜烟儿跑不见了。

As for who he was and what he was doing, I couldn’t say.

> 至于他是谁、来做什么，我也说不清。

Later, I walked ten miles, took a train from Tunbridge Wells to London, and raised no suspicion.

> 后来我走了十英里，在坦布里奇韦尔斯坐火车到伦敦，没引起任何怀疑。

"I checked the tin box; there was no money inside, only some securities I dared not sell.

> “我检查了锡盒，里面没钱，只有一些证券，我不敢卖。

I couldn’t get Black Peter's hush money, and I was trapped in London, broke,

> 黑彼得的封口费是要不到了，我困在伦敦，身无分文，

having to rely on my old profession for food.

> 只能靠老本行吃饭。

I saw an advertisement for a harpooner with decent pay,

> 我看到招聘鱼叉手的启事，待遇还不错，

so I registered at a crew agency, and they sent me here.

> 就去船员中介公司登记，他们派我过来这里。

That’s everything I know.

> 这些是我知道的全部情况。

Once again, I killed Black Peter; the court should thank me,

> 再说一遍，我杀了黑彼得，法院应该感谢我，

for I saved them a noose."

> 我替他们省了一根绞绳。​”

"That was very clear," Holmes stood up and lit his pipe.

> “说得非常清楚了，​”福尔摩斯站起身，点燃烟斗，

"Hopkins, hurry up and take the prisoner to a secure place;

> “霍普金斯，抓紧时间把犯人押到安全的地方吧，

this room is not suitable as a cell.

> 这房间可不适合当牢房，

Mr. Patrick Keynes sits there, and there’s hardly any space left on the floor."

> 帕特里克·凯恩斯先生往那儿一坐，地上没多少空间了。​”

"Mr. Holmes," Hopkins said,

> “福尔摩斯先生，​”霍普金斯说，

"I truly don’t know how to express my gratitude.

> “真不知该怎么表达谢意。

I still don’t understand how you did it."

> 我到现在还不明白你是怎么办到的。​”

"It was just a matter of catching the right clues from the start.

> “只不过是从一开始就幸运地抓准了线索。

If I had known about that notebook beforehand,

> 如果事先知道有这么个记事本，

I might have gone astray like you.

> 我很可能也像你一样跑偏了。

All the information I heard pointed in the same direction—

> 我听说的所有信息都指向同一个方向——

incredible strength, skill with a harpoon, watered-down rum,

> 惊人的力量、使用鱼叉的技能、加水朗姆酒、

seal-skin pipe, and strong tobacco.

> 海豹皮烟袋、劲道大的烟丝——

All these pointed to a crew member, and specifically a whaling crew member.

> 所有这些都指向船员，而且是捕鲸船船员。

Black Peter rarely smoked, and there wasn’t even a pipe in the cabin.

> 黑彼得极少抽烟，木屋里连烟斗都没有，

I’m convinced the initials 'P.C.' on the pipe were just a coincidence,

> 我确信烟袋上的缩写‘P.C.’只是巧合，

not referring to Peter Carey.

> 并不是指彼得·凯里。

Remember when I asked if there was whiskey and brandy in the cabin?

> 记得吧，我问过你木屋有没有威士忌和白兰地，你说有？

Anyone who hasn’t lived on a ship wouldn’t choose to drink rum

> 没在船上生活过的人，有这两种酒在手边，又有几个会选择喝朗姆呢？

when having both of those types of alcohol available.

> 所以，凶手肯定是船员。​”

"How did you find him?"

> “你怎么找到他的？​”

"My dear sir, the question is quite simple at this point.

> “亲爱的先生，问题到这儿已经非常简单了。

Since he is a crew member, he can only be one who was on the 'Sea Unicorn' with Black Peter.

> 既然是船员，只可能是和黑彼得同在‘独角海兽号’上的船员。

From my investigation, Black Peter didn’t sail with any other ship.

> 据我调查，黑彼得没跟别的船出过海。

I spent three whole days communicating with Dundee port,

> 我花了整整三天跟邓迪港通信，

and ultimately confirmed the list of all crew members on the 'Sea Unicorn' in 1883.

> 最终确定了1883年‘独角海兽号’上所有船员的名单。

When I saw Patrick Keynes's name among the harpooners, the case was closed.

> 当看到帕特里克·凯恩斯的名字出现在鱼叉手中，案子告罄。

He might be in London, eager to leave England for a while,

> 他可能在伦敦，着急想离开英国一段时间，

so I wandered around East London for a few days,

> 于是我到伦敦东区转悠了几天，

designing an Arctic expedition under the alias Captain Basil,

> 设计了北冰洋探险之旅，化名巴兹尔船长，

offering attractive conditions to recruit a harpooner.

> 开出优厚条件招聘鱼叉手。

See, I managed to lure him in!"

> 看，招来了吧！”

"Impressive!" Hopkins exclaimed,

> “厉害！”霍普金斯赞叹，

"That’s truly remarkable!"

> “太厉害了！”

"You need to release Neligan quickly," Holmes said.

> “你要尽快放了内利根，​”福尔摩斯说，

"To be honest, I think you should apologize to him.

> “坦白说，我觉得你应该给人家道歉。

And the tin box should be returned to him.

> 锡盒也要还给他。

Of course, the securities that Peter Carey sold cannot be recovered.

> 当然了，彼得·凯里卖掉的那些证券没法追回了。

Hopkins, the carriage has arrived; take the prisoner away.

> 霍普金斯，马车来了，带犯人走吧。

Watson and I are going to Norway;

> 我和华生要去挪威，

if you need me to appear in court, write to me, and I’ll give you the specific address later."

> 需要我出庭的话，写信联系，具体地址回头告诉你。​”
