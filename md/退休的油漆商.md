# 退休的油漆商

### 1

That morning, Holmes was gloomy and anxious, a common mood for someone as sensitive and practical as he was.
> 那天上午，福尔摩斯心情阴郁，忧心忡忡，天性敏感又务实的人常常出现这种情绪反应。

"Did you see him?" he asked.
> “看见他了？”他问。

"The elderly man who just left?"
> “你说刚出去的老人？”

"Yes."
> “对。”

"I did. I ran into him at the door."
> “看见了，门口碰到的。”

"What did you think of him?"
> “什么感觉？”

"A pitiful, useless, broken man."
> “可怜又没用的落魄人。”

"Exactly, Watson—pitiful and useless.
> “没错，华生，可怜又没用。

Isn’t that a reflection of all humanity?
> 这世上谁不是可怜又没用呢？

We reach out, we grasp with all our might, but in the end, what do we hold in our hands?
> 他不正是整个人类的缩影吗？我们伸出手，我们用力抓，到最后手里又剩下什么呢？

Bubbles—or worse, pain."
> 泡影，或者比泡影更糟糕，痛苦。”

"Is he your client?"
> “他是你的客户？”

"Sort of.
> “嗯，算是吧，

He was sent by Scotland Yard, just as doctors sometimes send incurable patients to quacks.
> 警察厅打发来的，就像医生偶尔把治不好的病人打发给江湖郎中。

They always say they’ve done their best, but there’s no hope of recovery."
> 他们总是解释说，尽力了，再怎么治也不可能好转。”

"What case is it?"
> “什么案子？”

Holmes picked up a grimy business card from the table.
> 福尔摩斯从桌上拿起一张脏兮兮的名片：

"Josiah Amberley.
> “乔塞亚·安伯利，

He claims to be a junior partner in the Brickfall & Amberley company, manufacturers of artists’ supplies—you might have seen their name on paint boxes.
> 他说是布里克福尔-安伯利公司的资浅合伙人，艺术用品制造商，可以在颜料盒上看见他们的名字。

He saved up a small fortune, retired at sixty-one, and bought a house in Lewisham.
> 他有一小笔积蓄，六十一岁退休，在刘易舍姆买了房，

After working hard all his life, he finally achieved a comfortable retirement.
> 辛苦一辈子，终于过上了闲适的生活。

To the average person, his old age should have been carefree."
> 一般人看来，他的晚年应该是无忧无虑了。”

"Indeed."
> “确实。”

Holmes glanced at some notes scribbled on the back of an envelope.
> 福尔摩斯瞥了眼随手记在信封背面的信息。

"He retired in 1896, Watson.
> “1896年退休，华生。

At the start of 1897, he married a woman twenty years younger than himself.
> 1897年年初，他和一个比自己小二十岁的女人结了婚。

If the photograph doesn’t lie, she’s quite a beautiful woman.
> 照片不说谎的话，还是个漂亮女人。

With money, leisure, and a wife, his future seemed bright.
> 有钱有闲有妻子，未来似乎一片坦途。

But as you’ve seen, less than two years later, he’s become one of the most downtrodden, miserable wretches alive."
> 可是你也看见了，不到两年，他成了天底下最落魄、最悲惨的可怜虫。”

"What happened?"
> “出了什么事？”

"The usual, Watson—betrayal by a friend and infidelity by a wife.
> “老一套，华生，朋友的背叛加妻子的不忠。

Amberley’s greatest passion is chess.
> 安伯利最大的爱好是下棋。

There’s a young doctor in Lewisham, living not far from him, who shares this interest.
> 刘易舍姆有个年轻医生，住得离他不远，也喜欢下棋。

I’ve noted his name: Dr. Ray Ernest.
> 我记下了他的名字，雷·欧内斯特医生。

Our poor client may lack inner beauty, but he certainly lacks outer beauty as well.
> 先不说我们这位可怜的委托人内在怎么样，反正外在美是没有的。

Dr. Ernest frequently visited his house and naturally grew close to Amberley’s wife.
> 欧内斯特经常去他家，自然而然跟安伯利太太亲近起来。

Last week, the two eloped together, their whereabouts unknown.
> 这一对上周私奔了，去向不明。

Not only that, but the unfaithful wife took the old man’s deed box with her—most of his lifetime savings were in it.
> 不仅如此，不忠的妻子还把老人的文件箱带走了，他一生的大部分积蓄都在里面。

Can we find the lady? Can we recover the money?
> 我们能否找到女士？能否追回钱财？

It’s a perfectly ordinary case, but for Josiah Amberley, it’s a matter of utmost importance."
> 虽然目前来看只是个再普通不过的案子，但对乔塞亚·安伯利来说却是至关重要的问题。”

"What do you plan to do?"
> “你打算怎么办？”

"Ah, my dear Watson, the question is: what do *you* plan to do?
> “啊，亲爱的华生，眼下的问题恰恰是：‘你’打算怎么办？

I need you to take this on for me.
> 请你替我出马。

You know I’m preoccupied with the case of the two Coptic bishops, and today is a critical moment.
> 你知道的，我手头忙着科普特教会两位主教的案子，今天正是关键时刻。

I simply can’t spare the time to go to Lewisham, but the evidence at the scene is particularly valuable.
> 实在没时间去刘易舍姆，但案发地点的证据又特别有价值。

The old man insisted I should go myself. I explained my difficulty, and he agreed to let me send a representative."
> 老头子非要我去，我说明了难处，他答应让我派个代表。”

"No problem," I replied.
> “没问题，”我回答，

"To be honest, I doubt I’ll be much help, but I’ll do my best."
> “老实说，我不见得能帮多大忙，但一定会尽全力。”

And so, that summer afternoon, I set off for Lewisham.
> 就这样，那个夏天的下午，我动身前往刘易舍姆。

Little did I know that within a week, the case I was involved in would become the talk of all England.
> 万万没料到不出一周，我参与的案子竟成了全英国的热门话题。

That night, I returned to Baker Street to report on my progress.
> 当天深夜，我回到贝克街汇报任务完成情况。

Holmes was reclining in his large armchair, his long, lean frame stretched out.
> 福尔摩斯仰靠坐在宽大的椅子上，伸直瘦长的身子。

His pipe sent up a series of acrid smoke rings.
> 烟斗慢慢飘出一个个烟圈，味道刺鼻。

He lazily drooped his eyelids, appearing almost asleep.
> 他懒洋洋耷拉着眼皮，仿佛睡着了一样。

But whenever I paused or mentioned something suspicious, his eyelids would lift halfway, and his piercing grey eyes would dart toward me, sharp as daggers.
> 可是只要我停下来，或者出现了可疑的细节，眼皮就会抬起一半，两只明亮的灰眼睛像利剑一样刺向我，目光洞悉一切。”

"Amberley’s house is called ‘The Haven,’" I explained.
> “安伯利先生的房子叫避风港，”我解释道，

"You’d certainly find it interesting, Holmes.
> “你肯定会对那里感兴趣，福尔摩斯。

It’s like a fallen aristocrat, surrounded by a lower-class neighborhood.
> 它就像没落的贵族，跌到了下层人中间。

You know the area—rows of monotonous brick streets and dreary suburban roads.
> 你熟悉那一带，单调的砖街，沉闷的郊区公路。

In the midst of all that stands an old house, like a peaceful island steeped in ancient culture.
> 就在这样的地方立着一座古老的房子，好像一座充满古文化气息的安逸小岛。

It’s surrounded by a high wall, weather-beaten and covered in lichen and moss."
> 四周一圈高墙，饱经曝晒，墙面地衣斑驳，墙头苔藓密布。”

"Spare me the poetry, Watson," Holmes said sternly.
> “不要诗朗诵了，华生，”福尔摩斯严肃地说，

"I get it—a very high brick wall."
> “我明白了，很高的砖墙。”

### 2

"Exactly. Fortunately, there was a man smoking on the street.
> “没错。幸亏街上有个抽烟的闲人，

If I hadn’t asked him, I wouldn’t have known which house was The Haven.
> 要不是问他，我真不知道哪一家才是避风港。

This man is worth mentioning—tall, with dark skin and a thick mustache.
> 这个人倒是值得一提，高个子，黝黑的皮肤，浓密的八字胡。

He looked like a soldier.
> 看上去像军人。

He pointed toward the house as his answer.
> 他朝房子的方向点点头，算是回答我。

Looking back, there was something oddly questioning in the way he looked at me."
> 事后回想起来，他看我的眼神似乎带着奇怪的质疑。”

"As soon as I entered the gate, I saw Mr. Amberley walking along the carriage drive.
> “我一进大门就看见安伯利先生沿马车道走来。

I only got a quick look at him this morning, and he struck me as peculiar.
> 上午只匆匆看过他一眼，给我的印象是个怪人。

Now, seeing him more clearly, he seemed even more unusual."
> 现在看得更清楚了，越发觉得不正常。”

"I’ve studied his appearance myself, but I’d like to hear your impressions," said Holmes.
> “我当然也研究过他的外貌，不过还是很想听听你的感觉。”福尔摩斯说。

"To say he was bent under the weight of his troubles would not be an exaggeration.
> “说他被烦恼压弯了腰都不夸张。

His back was hunched as if carrying a heavy burden.
> 他的背是弯曲的，好像背着沉重的包袱。

At first, I thought he was weak, but actually, his shoulders and chest were solidly built, like a strong man’s.
> 一开始我以为他很虚弱，其实不然，肩膀和胸膛像壮汉一样结实。

However, his legs were thin, making him top-heavy."
> 但是两条腿却很细，有点头重脚轻。”

"The left shoe was wrinkled, and the right shoe was smooth."
> “左边的鞋起了皱，右边的鞋很平整。”

"I didn’t notice that."
> “这我没注意。”

"Yes, I didn’t expect you to. I observed that he has a prosthetic leg.
> “是啊，你不会注意到的，我发现他装了假肢。

Go on."
> 接着说。”

"He wore an old straw hat, under which his graying, curly hair showed.
> “他戴着一顶旧草帽，帽子下露出花白卷曲的头发。

His face was deeply lined, and his expression was intense and urgent.
> 脸上爬满深深的皱纹，表情激动急切，这些都让我印象深刻。”

"Very good, Watson. What did he say?"
> “很好，华生，他说了什么？”

"He began pouring out his troubles.
> “他开始大吐苦水。

As we walked along the carriage drive, I took the opportunity to observe the surroundings.
> 我们沿马车道往前走，我趁机观察了周围的环境。

I’ve never seen such a neglected place.
> 我从没见过这么乱的地方。

The garden plants were withered, clearly untended and untrimmed, left to grow wild.
> 花园里的植物都枯萎了，看来根本没人打理和修剪，任它们自生自灭。

I can’t imagine any respectable woman tolerating such a state.
> 真不知道哪个体面女人能忍受这种状态。

The house itself was in equally poor condition.
> 房子也一样，乱得不成样子。

The poor old man seemed to realize this and was trying to remedy it.
> 可怜的老头子似乎也意识到了，正试图补救。

There was a large can of green paint in the center of the hallway, and he held a thick brush in his left hand.
> 门厅中央放着一大罐绿油漆，他左手拿着厚刷子。

Apparently, he’d been painting the woodwork."
> 之前一直在粉刷木建部分。”

"He took me into a dimly lit private room, and we talked for quite some time.
> “他带我进了昏暗的私室，我们聊了很长时间。

He was clearly disappointed that you hadn’t come in person.
> 你本人没去，他显然非常遗憾。

He said, ‘A little man like me, now facing such heavy financial losses, must not be worth the attention of a famous man like Mr. Holmes.’"
> 他说：‘像我这样的小人物，现在又遭受了惨重的经济损失，想必不值得福尔摩斯先生这样的大名人花费心思。’”

"I assured him it had nothing to do with his financial situation.
> “我向他保证这跟经济状况无关。”

‘Of course not,’ he said. ‘He’s a man who works for art’s sake.
> ‘当然无关，他是为艺术而艺术的人，’他说。

But speaking of the art of crime, he might find a subject for study here.
> ‘不过说到犯罪的艺术层面，他也许能在这里发现研究对象。

And human nature, Dr. Watson—the dark, ungrateful side of human nature!
> 还有人性，华生医生，忘恩负义的黑暗人性！

When have I ever refused her anything?
> 我什么时候拒绝过她的要求？

What woman was ever more indulged than she?
> 有哪个女人比她更受宠爱？

That young man—I treated him like a son, letting him come and go as he pleased.
> 那个年轻人，我一直当儿子一样看待，随便他进出我家。

And look how they repaid me! Ah, Dr. Watson, the world is a vile place!’"
> 再看看他们是怎么报答我的吧！唉，华生医生，这世界丑陋至极！’”

"He went on about this for over an hour.
> “他围绕这个话题说了一个多小时。

From what he said, it seemed he hadn’t noticed anything suspicious beforehand.
> 听他的意思，好像事先并没察觉他们不对劲。

The household consisted only of himself, his wife, and a maid who worked during the day and left at six in the evening.
> 家里只有夫妻两人，还有个女佣白天在，晚上六点下班。

On the night of the incident, old Amberley wanted to cheer up his wife and bought two tickets for the Haymarket Theatre, in the upper gallery.
> 案发当晚，老安伯利想让妻子开心一下，买了两张干草市场剧院三楼的票。

But when it was time to leave, she claimed she had a headache and didn’t want to go.
> 可是临出门了，她说头痛不想去。

So he went alone.
> 他只好一个人去了。

He showed me his wife’s unused ticket, which seemed genuine enough."
> 他给我看了妻子没用的那张票，应该是确有其事。”

"Unusual, very unusual," Holmes said with growing interest.
> “不寻常，太不寻常了，”福尔摩斯兴趣大增。

"Go on, Watson, your story is fascinating.
> “接着说，华生，你的故事很有吸引力。

Did you examine the ticket yourself? You didn’t note the seat number, did you?"
> 你亲自检查过戏票吗？没记下座位号吧？”

"I did, actually," I said proudly.
> “我还真记下来了，”我有些骄傲地说，

"It happened to be the same as my old school number—31—so it stuck in my mind."
> “碰巧是我以前的学号，31，所以记得特别清楚。”

"Excellent, Watson! That means his own seat was either 30 or 32."
> “好极了，华生！那他自己的座位号不是30就是32。”

"Exactly, in Row B," I replied, still puzzled as to why it mattered.
> “没错，B排。”我回答，不太明白他为什么提这个。

"Very good. What else did he say?"
> “非常好。他还说了什么？”

"He showed me a place he called the strongroom.
> “他带我看了一个地方，他称之为保险库。

It really was a strongroom, like one you’d see in a bank, with iron doors and shutters.
> 的的确确是保险库，跟银行的一样，门和护窗板都是铁制的。

He said it was burglar-proof.
> 他说可以防盗。

Apparently, his wife had a key, and the two of them took about £7,000 worth of cash and securities.
> 不过他妻子好像有把钥匙，两人拿走了价值大约七千英镑的现金和证券。”

"Securities? What use are securities?"
> “证券？拿证券有什么用？”

"He said he’d reported the list of securities to the police, so they wouldn’t be convertible.
> “他说已经向警方报备了证券清单，肯定是没法变现了。

He returned home from the theater around midnight and found the strongroom looted, doors and windows wide open.
> 他大概午夜时分从剧院回到家，发现保险库被盗，门窗大开。

The thieves were gone, leaving no letter or message, and there’s been no word since.
> 盗贼已不见踪影，没留下任何信件或消息，之后音信全无。

He immediately called the police."
> 他当即报了警。”

Holmes pondered for a moment. "You said he was painting—what was he painting?"
> 福尔摩斯沉思了片刻。“你说他在刷油漆，刷什么地方？”

"Oh, the hallway. The door of the strongroom and the woodwork had already been painted."
> “哦，走廊。保险库的门和木建部分已经刷完了。”

"Doing that sort of work at a time like this—don’t you find it strange?"
> “这种时候干这种活，你不觉得奇怪吗？”

"‘One must find something to soothe a wounded heart.’ That was his explanation.
> “‘总得找点事情抚慰受伤的心。’这是他本人的解释。

It’s strange, yes, but he is a strange man.
> 奇怪是奇怪，但他本身就是个怪人。

He was furious—he tore up a photograph of his wife in front of me, shouting, ‘I never want to see that damned face again!’"
> 他怒火中烧，当着我的面狠狠撕碎了一张妻子的照片，尖声叫道：‘我再也不想见到这张该死的脸。’”

"Anything else to add, Watson?"
> “还有补充的吗，华生？”

"Yes, one thing that left a strong impression.
> “有，一件印象最深的事。

I took a carriage to Blackheath Station and caught the train.
> 我坐马车到了布莱克希思车站，赶上火车。

Just as it was pulling out, I saw a man rush into the next carriage.
> 就在开动的瞬间，我看见一个男人冲进了隔壁车厢。

Holmes, you know I can recognize a face instantly.
> 福尔摩斯，你知道我能一眼识别人脸。

It was the same tall, dark man I had asked for directions earlier on the street.
> 他正是街上那个又高又黑的男人，我找他问过路。

I saw him again at London Bridge, but after that, he disappeared into the crowd.
> 到了伦敦桥又看见他一回，后来就消失在人群中了。

I’m certain he was following me."
> 我敢肯定他是在跟踪我。”

"Exactly! Exactly!" Holmes said.
> “没错！没错！”福尔摩斯说，

"You said he was tall, dark-skinned, with a thick mustache, and wearing gray-tinted glasses?"
> “你说他高个子，黝黑的皮肤，浓密的八字胡，戴着灰色墨镜？”

"Holmes, that’s incredible! I didn’t mention the gray glasses, but he was wearing them."
> “福尔摩斯，太神奇了，灰色墨镜我没说，但他确实戴了。”

"And a Masonic tie pin?"
> “还有共济会领带针？”

"Holmes!"
> “福尔摩斯！”

"Obvious, my dear Watson.
> “显而易见，亲爱的华生。

Now let’s focus on the practical matters.
> 我们还是先看看实际问题吧。

To be honest, at first I thought this case was absurdly simple and not worth our attention.
> 坦白说，一开始我觉得这案子简单得离谱，根本不值得关注。

But it quickly took on an entirely different aspect.
> 但它很快又呈现出截然不同的一面。

Your fieldwork missed all the crucial details and focused only on the obvious.
> 你的实地考察忽略了所有重要信息，只注意到一些明摆着的事。

Even so, it’s enough to provoke deeper thought."
> 尽管如此，也足以引发深入的思考。”

"What did I miss?"
> “忽略了什么？”

"Don’t take it personally, my dear fellow.
> “别往心里去，亲爱的老兄。

You know I don’t mean it as a criticism.
> 你知道我不是针对你。

No one could have done better—some might even have done worse—but you did overlook a few key points.
> 没人能做得更好，有些说不定还不如你，但你确实忽略了一些重点。

What do the neighbors think of the Amberleys? That’s clearly important.
> 邻居对安伯利夫妇的看法如何？这点显然很重要。

What kind of reputation does Dr. Ernest have? Might he be a philanderer?
> 欧内斯特医生口碑如何？会不会是个风流浪荡子？

Watson, with your natural charm, any woman would gladly help you.
> 华生，凭你天生的优势，任何女人都能助你一臂之力。

Why didn’t you ask the women at the post office, or the greengrocer’s wife?
> 为什么不问问邮局的女员工？或者蔬果店的老板娘？

You could have gone to the Blue Anchor Tavern and exchanged a few meaningless words with the young ladies there.
> 你完全可以去蓝锚酒馆，轻声细语地跟年轻女士聊几句废话。

Reliable information would surely follow.
> 肯定能换来可靠情报。

But you didn’t do any of that."
> 可惜这些你都没做。”

"It’s not too late to do it now."
> “现在做还来得及。”

"It’s already been done.
> “已经做过了。

With the telephone and the assistance of Scotland Yard, I often gather critical information without leaving the house.
> 有电话和警察厅帮忙，我经常不出门就能打探到关键信息。

In fact, my findings confirm the man’s story.
> 事实上，我的信息证实了这个人的说法。

He’s locally known as a miser and a strict husband.
> 他在当地是出了名的守财奴，也是一个严苛的丈夫。

His strongroom did contain a large sum of money.
> 他的保险库里确实放了一大笔钱。

Dr. Ernest is unmarried and genuinely played chess with Amberley, so he might have seduced the wife.
> 年轻的欧内斯特医生还没结婚，跟安伯利下棋也确有其事，有可能勾引了他的妻子。

Everything seems to align perfectly, with no further explanation needed.
> 一切似乎都在情理之中，不需要再解释什么。

But—oh, but!"
> 可是啊可是！”

"Do you have doubts?"
> “有疑点吗？”

"Perhaps it’s just my imagination.
> “也许只是我的想象罢了。

Enough for now, Watson.
> 好了，到此为止，华生。

Let us escape this mundane world through the side door of music.
> 让我们从音乐的偏门逃离这庸俗世界吧。

Carina is performing at the Albert Hall tonight.
> 卡琳娜今晚在艾伯特音乐厅演唱。

We still have time to change, have dinner, and enjoy the evening."
> 我们还有时间换衣服、吃晚饭，好好享受一番。”

The next morning, I woke early and saw crumbs and two empty eggshells, proof that my friend had risen even earlier.
> 第二天，我起了个大早，看到面包屑和两个空蛋壳，知道我朋友起得更早。

On the table was a hastily written note.
> 桌上有张潦草的字条。

"Dear Watson:
> “亲爱的华生：

Regarding Mr. Amberley’s case, I want to meet one or two people before deciding whether to continue the investigation.
> 关于安伯利先生的案子，我还想见一两个人，之后再决定是否继续调查。

Please wait at home around three o’clock—I may need your help.
> 请你三点左右在家等候，可能需要你帮忙。

S.H."
> S.H.”

I didn’t see Holmes all day, but at the appointed time, he returned, looking grave and focused, saying nothing.
> 一天没见到福尔摩斯，到了约定时间，他回来了，神情严肃专注，冷漠不语。

At such times, it’s best not to disturb him.
> 这种时候最好不要打扰他。

"Amberley hasn’t arrived yet?"
> “安伯利还没来？”

"No."
> “没有。”

"Ah! I’m expecting him."
> “啊！我正等着他呢。”

He wasn’t disappointed—the old man soon arrived, his grim face showing great confusion.
> 他没失望，老头子很快就到了，严峻的脸上露出非常困惑的表情。

"I’ve received a telegram, Mr. Holmes, and I have no idea what it means."
> “我收到了一封电报，福尔摩斯先生，完全不懂什么意思。”

He handed the telegram to Holmes, who read it aloud:
> 他把电报递过来，福尔摩斯大声念道：

"‘Regarding your recent loss, I can provide information.
> ‘有关你最近的损失，我能提供线索。

Please come at once.
> 务必速来。

Ellman, The Rectory.’"
> 埃尔曼, 牧师住宅。”

### 4

"Sent at 2:10 from Little Purlington," Holmes said.
> “两点十分从小珀林顿发出，”福尔摩斯说，

"I know Little Purlington—it’s in Essex, not far from Frinton.
> “小珀林顿我知道，在艾塞克斯郡，离弗林顿不远。

Of course, you must go immediately.
> 当然要马上去，

It’s from the local vicar, a source that is absolutely trustworthy.
> 这可是当地牧师发的，绝对信得过。

Where’s my *Crockford’s*? Found it—here: ‘J.C. Elman, M.A., Vicar of Mooton-cum-Purlington.’
> 我那本《克罗克福德》呢？找到了，这里：‘J.C.埃尔曼，文学硕士，任穆斯穆尔、小珀林顿教区牧师。’

Watson, check the train schedule."
> 华生，查一下火车趟次。”

"There’s one at 5:20 from Liverpool Street."
> “五点二十分利物浦街有一趟。”

"Excellent, Watson.
> “好极了，华生，

You’d better go with him—he may need help or advice.
> 你最好陪他一起去，他可能需要帮助或建议，

The case is clearly at a critical stage."
> 案子显然到了关键时刻。”

However, the client showed no intention of leaving.
> 可是委托人却丝毫没有动身的意思。

"Utter nonsense, Mr. Holmes," he said.
> “太荒唐了，福尔摩斯先生，”他说，

"How could this person know anything about what happened?
> “这个人怎么可能知道发生了什么？

It’s a complete waste of time and money."
> 纯属浪费时间和金钱。”

"If he didn’t know something, he wouldn’t have sent the telegram.
> “要不是知道了什么，他不会给你发电报。

Send a reply immediately, saying you’ll go."
> 马上回电说你要去。”

"I don’t want to go."
> “我不想去。”

Holmes’s expression became stern.
> 福尔摩斯一脸严肃。

"Mr. Amberley, this behavior will leave a very poor impression on both me and the police.
> “安伯利先生，你这样只会给我和警方留下极坏的印象，

If you refuse to follow such an obvious lead, we’ll suspect you have no real intention of solving this case."
> 如此明显的线索你都不去追，我们怀疑你根本没诚意查案。”

The client was startled by this and said,
> 一听这话，委托人吓坏了，说：

"Well, if that’s how you see it, I’ll go.
> “哎呀，既然你们这么想，我去就是了。

It does sound absurd that this vicar would have a lead, but if you think so..."
> 说这位牧师有线索，乍一听确实很荒唐，可是如果你认为……”

"I *do* think so," Holmes said emphatically.
> “我就是这么认为的。”福尔摩斯加重语气说道。

And with that, the trip was settled.
> 于是出行定了下来。

Before we left the room, Holmes pulled me aside and gave me a few instructions, indicating how seriously he regarded the matter.
> 我们离开房间前，福尔摩斯把我拉到一边叮嘱了几句，看得出他相当重视此事。

"Make sure he goes, no matter what," he said.
> “无论如何一定要让他去，”他说，

"If he tries to escape or returns prematurely, go to the nearest telegraph office and send just one word: ‘Run.’
> “如果他逃走或者回来了，立刻去最近的电话局，只用说一句‘跑了’就行，

I’ll have arrangements on this end to receive your message promptly."
> 我在这边做好安排，确保及时收到你的消息。”

Little Purlington is on a branch line, making it a difficult destination to reach.
> 小珀林顿位于支线，去一趟不容易。

The journey was far from pleasant.
> 一路上留下的回忆并不怎么愉快。

The weather was hot, the train was slow, and my companion was sullen and silent.
> 天气炎热，车速极慢，旅伴闷闷不乐，一声不吭。

Occasionally, he made sarcastic remarks, saying this trip was a complete waste of time.
> 偶尔嘲讽几句，说我们这趟完全是白跑。

At last, we reached the small station, took a carriage for two miles, and arrived at the vicarage.
> 终于抵达小车站，又坐了两英里马车，最后到了牧师住宅。

In the study, we were greeted by a large-framed vicar with a serious and somewhat haughty demeanor.
> 我们在书房见到了一位大块头牧师，神情严肃，透着几分高傲。

He had our telegram in front of him.
> 他面前放着我们的电报。

"Well, gentlemen, what can I do for you?" he asked.
> “怎么，两位，有何贵干？”他问。

"We came because of your telegram," I explained.
> “我们收到你的电报才来的。”我解释道。

"My telegram? I didn’t send a telegram."
> “我的电报？我没发电报。”

"I’m referring to the one you sent to Mr. Josiah Amberley, regarding his wife and his money."
> “我是说你发给乔塞亚·安伯利先生的电报，关于他的妻子和钱财。”

"Sir, this is no joke," the vicar said indignantly.
> “先生，这个玩笑一点儿也不好笑。”牧师气愤地说，

"I’ve never heard of this Mr. Amberley, nor have I sent anyone a telegram."
> “你说的先生我从没听说过，也没给任何人发过电报。”

Amberley and I exchanged astonished glances.
> 我和委托人惊讶地对望一眼。

"It must be a misunderstanding," I said.
> “可能是误会，”我说，

"Perhaps there’s another vicarage?
> “也许有两个牧师住宅？

The telegram is here—it’s signed ‘Elman’ and addressed to ‘The Rectory.’"
> 电报在这里，署名是埃尔曼，地址是牧师住宅。”

"There is only one rectory here, sir, and only one vicar.
> “牧师住宅只有一个，先生，牧师也只有一个。

This telegram is a malicious forgery, and the police should investigate its origin.
> 这封电报是可恶的伪造，必须叫警察来查明它的来历。

There’s no point in continuing this conversation."
> 我们没必要谈下去了。”

And with that, Amberley and I found ourselves back on the roadside in what must be one of England’s most primitive villages.
> 就这样，我和安伯利先生回到了路边，那一带简直是英国最原始的村庄。

We tried the post office, but it was closed.
> 我们去了邮局，关门了。

Fortunately, the Railway Arms, a small tavern, had a telephone.
> 还好铁路纹章小酒馆有电话。

I contacted Holmes, who was just as surprised as we were by the outcome.
> 我联系上了福尔摩斯，他听到这个结果也一样惊讶。

"How strange!" came his distant voice.
> “太奇怪了！”遥远的声音说，

"How utterly absurd!
> “太离谱了！

My dear Watson, it seems you’ll have to spend the night at a country inn.
> 亲爱的华生，今晚恐怕没返程车了，

I didn’t expect this to inconvenience you so.
> 没想到会连累你在乡村旅馆熬一夜。

But at least you’ll have nature for company, Watson—nature and Josiah Amberley.
> 不过，至少还有大自然做伴，华生，大自然和乔塞亚·安伯利，都是最好的陪伴。”

As he hung up, I heard a faint chuckle.
> 他挂电话的时候，我听见了几声干笑。

I quickly discovered that Amberley’s reputation as a miser was well deserved.
> 我很快发现，旅伴的守财奴称号真不是徒有虚名。

He complained about the cost of the trip, insisting on traveling third class.
> 他不满行程中的开销，坚持坐三等车厢。

Now he was grumbling about the price of lodging.
> 现在又开始抗议住宿费用。

The next morning, we finally returned to London, though it was hard to say whose mood was worse—his or mine.
> 第二天上午终于回到伦敦，很难说我和他谁的心情更糟糕。

"You’d better stop by Baker Street," I suggested.
> “你最好顺便去一下贝克街，”我说，

"Mr. Holmes may have new instructions."
> “福尔摩斯先生可能有新安排。”

"If it’s as pointless as this trip, it’ll be useless," Amberley said bitterly.
> “如果还是这么无聊的安排，一样没用。”安伯利恶狠狠地瞪着眼。

Nevertheless, he accompanied me there.
> 尽管如此，还是跟我一起去了。

"I had sent a telegram to Holmes informing him of our arrival time, but when we got there, we found a note saying he was in Lewisham and asking us to join him there.
> “我已经发电报告诉福尔摩斯到达时间，到了那儿却发现一张字条，说他在刘易舍姆，叫我们也过去。

It was an unexpected turn, but what came next was even more surprising.
> 真是个意外，不过更意外的事还在后头。

He wasn’t sitting alone in the client’s drawing room—beside him was a stern, cold-faced man with dark skin, gray-tinted glasses, and a large Masonic tie pin prominently displayed.
> 他并不是一个人待在委托人家的客厅里，旁边还坐着一个严肃冷峻的男人，皮肤黝黑，戴着灰色墨镜，一枚硕大的共济会领带针格外显眼。”

"This is my friend, Mr. Barker," Holmes said.
> “这是我朋友巴克先生，”福尔摩斯说，

"He’s also interested in your case, Mr. Amberley.
> “他也对你的案子感兴趣，安伯利先生。

We’ve been conducting separate investigations, but we have a shared question to ask you!"
> 我们各查各的，但有个共同问题想问你！”

Mr. Amberley sank heavily into a chair, and from his nervous eyes and distorted expression, it was clear he sensed danger closing in.
> 安伯利先生重重坐下去，从紧张的眼神、扭曲的表情可以看出，他察觉到危险临近。

"What question, Mr. Holmes?"
> “什么问题，福尔摩斯先生？”

"Very simple: what have you done with the bodies?"
> “很简单：你把尸体怎么了？”

The man sprang to his feet with a hoarse scream, his bony hands clawing the air, his mouth wide open, suddenly resembling a terrifying predator.
> 那人猛地跳起来，发出一声嘶哑的尖叫，干瘦的双手在空中乱抓，嘴巴大张，一下子变得像可怕的猛禽。

At that moment, we saw the true face of Josiah Amberley—a grotesque devil, his soul as twisted as his body.
> 就在这一瞬间，我们目睹了乔塞亚·安伯利的真面目——一个畸形的魔鬼，灵魂跟身体一样扭曲。

He collapsed into his chair, one hand quickly covering his mouth as if to stifle a cough.
> 他倒进椅子里，一只手迅速捂住嘴，像要压制住咳嗽。

Holmes leapt at his throat like a tiger, forcing his face to the ground, and a small white pill rolled out of his gasping mouth.
> 福尔摩斯猛虎般扑向他的喉咙，把他的脸按向地面，一颗白色小药丸从喘着粗气的嘴里掉了出来。

"No shortcuts, Amberley; things will proceed step by step. Barker, how’s it looking?"
> “别想走捷径，安伯利，事情得按规矩一步步来。巴克，怎么样？”

"I’ve arranged for a carriage to wait at the door," said the previously silent companion.
> “我安排了马车等在门口。”这位之前一言未发的同伴说。

"The police station is only a few hundred yards away. Let’s take him there together. Watson, you stay here; I’ll be back in half an hour."
> “这里离警局只有几百码，我们一起去。华生，你留下，我半小时内回来。”

The old paint dealer, though as strong as a lion, was no match for two skilled grapplers.
> 老颜料商身体壮实，力量如同雄狮，但被两个擒拿高手控制住。

Despite his struggles, he was dragged into the waiting carriage.
> 再怎么挣扎，还是被拽进了等候中的马车。

I was left alone in this ominous place.
> 我一个人守在这个不祥之地。

Less than half an hour later, Holmes returned, accompanied by a sharp-looking young detective.
> 不到半小时，福尔摩斯回来了，同来的还有一个模样机灵的年轻警探。

"I left Barker to handle the formalities," said Holmes.
> “我让巴克留下办手续。”福尔摩斯说。

"Watson, you don’t know Barker—he’s my most formidable competitor along the Surrey coast.
> “华生，你不认识巴克，他是我在萨里海岸一带最有力的竞争对手。

When you mentioned a tall, dark man, I could easily infer the rest of his description.
> 听你提到一个又高又黑的男人，我自然能轻松说出其他特征。

He’s solved several impressive cases, hasn’t he, Detective?"
> 他破过好几个不错的案子，是吧，警探先生？”

"Indeed, he’s interfered in several cases," the detective replied cautiously.
> “确实好几次插手。”警探显然持保留态度。

"Of course, his methods are unconventional, much like mine.
> “当然了，他的方法不走寻常路，跟我的一样。

You know, irregulars can sometimes be very useful.
> 你知道的，非正规军有时候能派上大用场。

For example, you have to follow protocol and warn him that anything he says can be used as evidence in court.
> 比方说吧，你必须按程序警告他，所说的每句话都将成为呈堂证供。

But that kind of approach won’t intimidate a scoundrel like him—he’ll never confess."
> 这种方法吓唬不了这种无赖，他根本不可能招供。”

"Maybe, but sooner or later, we’ll get a confession, Mr. Holmes.
> “也许吧，但我们迟早能让他认罪，福尔摩斯先生。

Don’t think the police have no ideas or can’t catch criminals.
> 别以为警方对这个案子毫无想法、抓不到罪犯。

You irregulars step in, using methods we can’t, and take the credit.
> 你们插手进来，用我们不能用的方法抢功劳。

It’s no wonder we feel uncomfortable about it."
> 这也难怪我们心里不舒坦。”

"No one’s stealing credit, MacKinnon.
> “没人抢功劳，麦金农。

I assure you, I won’t show my face again in this matter.
> 我保证从此不再露面。

As for Barker, he only did what I asked him to do."
> 至于巴克，他只是做了我交代的事。”

The detective seemed somewhat mollified.
> 警探心里似乎宽慰了许多。

"You’re very generous, Mr. Holmes.
> “你真大度，福尔摩斯先生。

For you, praise or criticism doesn’t seem to matter, but it’s different for us—the newspapers won’t leave us alone."
> 赞扬、批评对你来说无所谓，我们就不一样了，报纸会盯着我们不放。”

"True enough.
> “确实。

In any case, they’ll have questions, and you’d better be ready with answers.
> 不管怎样，他们肯定是要提问的，最好准备好答案。

For example, if a clever and eager journalist asks what first aroused your suspicion and led you to confirm the facts, what will you say?"
> 举例说吧，如果聪明积极的记者问，到底是什么引起你的怀疑，最终使你确认了事实，怎么回答？”

The detective looked puzzled.
> 警探一脸困惑。

"Mr. Holmes, I don’t think we have any facts yet.
> “福尔摩斯先生，我们好像没掌握什么事实。

You’ve said the suspect attempted suicide in front of three witnesses, effectively admitting to killing his wife and her lover.
> 你说罪犯当着三个证人的面企图自杀，实际上是承认自己杀了妻子和她的情人。

Is there anything else?"
> 难道还有别的事实？”

"Are you planning to search the house?"
> “你打算搜查房子吗？”

"I’ve already arranged for three officers to come."
> “已经安排三名警察过来了。”

"Then you’ll soon have solid facts.
> “到时候就有确凿的事实了。

The bodies should be nearby.
> 尸体应该在附近。

Search the cellar and the garden—it won’t take long to cover all possible locations.
> 你们搜一下地窖和花园，用不了多久就能搜遍所有可能的地方。

This house was built before plumbing existed, so there must be an abandoned well—try your luck there too."
> 这房子修建的年代还没水管，肯定有废弃的水井，也可以去碰碰运气。”

### 6

"How do you know it was him who killed them? And how did he do it?"
> “你怎么知道是他杀的？怎么杀的？”

"Let’s start with how he did it and then explain the rest.
> “先说说怎么杀的，再解释其他。

I owe you both an explanation, especially my companion here, who has endured quite a bit and played an important role in this investigation.
> 我确实欠你们一个解释，尤其是这位朋友，吃了不少苦头，在整个调查中发挥了重要作用。

First, let me remind you to consider this man’s psychology.
> 首先想提醒你们注意这个人的心理。

He is deeply twisted, and I suspect his ultimate destination is not the gallows but Broadmoor.
> 极度扭曲，我甚至觉得他最后的归宿不是绞刑架，而是布罗德穆尔。

His mind resembles that of a medieval Italian rather than a modern Englishman.
> 他的心理不像现代英国人，倒像中世纪的意大利人，相似度极高。

He is a despicable miser.
> 他是个可鄙的守财奴。

His wife, oppressed by his stinginess, became an easy target for an adventurer—and the chess-playing doctor was just such a man.
> 妻子因为他的吝啬苦闷不堪，很容易沦为冒险家的猎物，而下棋的医生正是这样一个角色。

Amberley is skilled at chess, Watson, which suggests he is highly strategic.
> 安伯利擅长下棋——华生，说明他精于心计。

Like all misers, he is intensely jealous, to the point of madness.
> 他跟所有守财奴一样，嫉妒心强，已经发展到疯狂的程度。

He suspected an affair between the two, and whether it was true or not, he decided on revenge, devising a cruel and cunning plan.
> 他怀疑两人有奸情，也不管是不是真的，就决定采取报复，设计了残忍狡猾的办法。

Come with me!"
> 跟我来！”

Holmes led us through the hallway with the confidence of someone who had lived there.
> 福尔摩斯带我们穿过走廊，自信的样子就像在这房子里住过。

He stopped at the door to the strongroom, which stood open.
> 他在保险库门口停下，门敞开着。

"Phew! What a horrible smell of paint!" the detective exclaimed.
> “呸呸！好难闻的油漆味！”警探叫道。

"That’s the first clue," Holmes said.
> “这是第一条线索，”福尔摩斯说。

"You can thank Dr. Watson’s observations, though he didn’t grasp their significance.
> “你得感谢华生医生的观察，虽然他没看出其中的含义。

It was the smell of paint that gave me the breakthrough.
> 我是闻着油漆味找到了突破口。

Why would anyone fill a house with such a strong smell at a time like this?
> 他为什么在这种时候让房子里充满强烈的气味？

Clearly, it was to mask another odor—one that could expose the crime.
> 显然是想掩盖其他气味——一种有可能暴露犯罪的气味。

Then I thought of this room, which you’ve seen: iron doors, iron shutters, completely airtight.
> 然后我又想到了这个房间，你们也看见了，铁门铁窗板，密不透风。

What conclusion can you draw from these two points?
> 以上两点结合起来，能得出什么结论？

To answer that, I had to inspect the house myself."
> 要回答这个问题，我必须亲自检查一下房子。”

"I checked the Haymarket Theatre’s ticket records—thanks again to Watson’s sharp observation—and confirmed that seats 30 and 32 in Row B were unoccupied that night.
> “我查过干草市场剧院的票房记录——又得感谢华生医生的敏锐观察——确定当晚三楼B排30号和32号都没人坐。

This made me realize the case was far from ordinary.
> 因此意识到这案子非同小可。

Amberley never went to the theatre; his alibi was entirely fabricated.
> 安伯利没去剧院，不在场证据根本站不住脚。

He made a careless mistake by letting my observant friend see his wife’s ticket.
> 他犯了个低级错误，让这位机敏的朋友看到了他妻子的座位号。

The next challenge was figuring out how to get into the house for a proper inspection.
> 剩下的问题就是，怎样才能进房子里检查。”

"I conceived the idea of sending him a telegram to a remote village, arranging the trip so he would miss the return train.
> “我想到一个最难到达的村子，派人过去给嫌疑人发电报，特地把行程安排在赶不上返程车的时间。

I also had Watson accompany him to prevent any complications.
> 还让华生医生陪着他，以防意外。

The vicar’s name, of course, came from *Crockford’s*.
> 牧师的名字嘛，当然是从《克罗克福德》上找到的。

Does it all make sense now?"
> 清楚了吗？”

"Brilliant!" the detective said admiringly.
> “高明！”警探敬佩地赞叹。

"Don’t worry about interference; I successfully infiltrated the house.
> “不用担心干扰了，我成功潜入房子。

If I ever decided to change careers, I’d make an excellent burglar."
> 只要我愿意，随时能转行当强盗，而且一定能成为盗神。”

"Let’s examine my findings. Here’s a gas pipe running along the baseboard—do you see it? Good.
> “一起看看我的收获吧。这里有根煤气管，贴着壁脚板，看见了吗？很好。

The pipe goes up to the corner, where there’s a valve.
> 管子往上到了墙角，那里有个阀门。

Then it enters the strongroom, ending at the ceiling’s plaster rosette, completely concealed.
> 接着看，管子进了保险库，终端在天花板中央的石膏花饰里，完全被花饰遮住了。

The end is open, and when the valve outside is turned on, gas flows into the room.
> 终端是敞开的，只要打开外面的阀门，煤气就会进入房间。

With the doors and windows sealed and the valve fully open, anyone inside would lose consciousness within two minutes.
> 门窗密封，阀门开到最大，顶多两分钟，关在这个小房间里的人就会失去知觉。

I don’t know what trick he used to lure them inside, but once they were in, their lives were in his hands."
> 我不知道他用了什么诡计把他们骗进来，一旦进来了，性命就交到他手上了。”

The detective inspected the gas pipe with great interest.
> 警探颇有兴致地检查了煤气管，说：

"One of our officers did mention smelling gas, but the windows were open, and the paint smell was overwhelming—at least part of the house had been freshly painted.
> “我们有个警察提到了煤气味，不过当时门窗都开着，刷了油漆——至少有一部分刷了油漆。

According to Amberley, the painting started the day before the incident.
> 据安伯利自己说，粉刷是从案发头一天开始的。

What happened next, Mr. Holmes?"
> 福尔摩斯先生，后来呢？”

"Oh, what happened next was quite unexpected.
> “哦，后来的事大出意料。

At dawn, as I was climbing out of the storeroom window, I felt a hand grab my collar and heard a voice say, ‘Hey, you scoundrel, what are you doing here?’
> 天蒙蒙亮，我从贮藏室的窗户往外爬，突然感到一只手揪住了我的衣领，有个声音说：‘喂，混蛋，你在这儿做什么？’

I turned and saw a pair of dark glasses—it was my friend and rival, Mr. Barker.
> 我扭过头，看见一副墨镜，是我的朋友兼对手巴克先生。

It was a remarkable coincidence, and we both laughed.
> 真是一场奇妙的偶遇，我们俩都笑了。

He had been hired by Dr. Ernest’s family to investigate and had also concluded it was murder.
> 他受欧内斯特医生的家人委托查案，也得出了谋杀的结论。

He had been surveilling the house for several days and saw Watson enter, marking him as a suspicious figure.
> 在房子周围监视了好几天，看见华生医生进去，把他归入了可疑人物之列。

He couldn’t ignore someone climbing out of the storeroom window, so he confronted me.
> 他不能逮捕华生，但是有人从贮藏室窗户爬出去，再也不能视而不见了。

Of course, I explained everything, and we joined forces to continue the investigation."
> 当然了，我向他解释了一番，我们联手继续查案。”

"Why him? Why not us?"
> “为什么是他？为什么不找我们？”

"Because I still wanted to conduct a small experiment.
> “因为我还想做个小实验。

The results were very satisfactory, but if you had been involved, the effect might not have been as good."
> 实验结果非常理想，要是你们在场，恐怕没这效果。”

The detective chuckled.
> 警探笑了。

"Perhaps so. Mr. Holmes, you earlier promised to withdraw from this case and hand over all findings to the police."
> “嗯，也许吧。福尔摩斯先生，你刚才保证从此退出此案，所有调查结果转交警方。”

"Indeed, that’s always been my practice."
> “没错，这是我的一贯风格。”

"Good. On behalf of the police, I thank you.
> “好，我代表警方感谢你。

Your explanation has clarified the case, and finding the bodies shouldn’t be difficult."
> 经你一解释，案情很明朗了，尸体应该也不难找。”

### 7

"I’ll show you one last, rather tragic piece of evidence," Holmes said.
> “我再给你看个很惨的小证据，”福尔摩斯说，

"Amberley himself probably hasn’t noticed it.
> “安伯利本人肯定也没发现。

Detective, always put yourself in the victim’s position—think about what you would do.
> 警探先生，永远都要设身处地，想想换作是你会怎么做，

That’s how you get to the truth.
> 这样就能得出结论。

It requires some imagination, but it’s worth it.
> 需要动用一点想象力，但绝对值得。

Now, suppose you were locked in this little room, knowing you wouldn’t survive two minutes.
> 好了，假设你被关进这个小房间，活不到两分钟，

That devil is probably outside the door, gloating.
> 那个恶魔说不定正在门外幸灾乐祸，

How would you try to get back at him?"
> 你想报复他，有什么办法？”

"Leave a message."
> “留下信息。”

"Exactly—to tell others how you died.
> “没错，告诉别人你是怎么死的。

Not on paper, as that could be too easily discovered.
> 不能写在纸上，容易被发现。

But on the wall, where someone would eventually see it.
> 可以写在墙上，总会有人看见的。

Now, look here!
> 好了，看这里！

Just above the baseboard, there are some scrawled words written with a purple indelible pencil:
> 壁脚板上方有几个潦草的字，用紫色防擦拭铅笔写的：

‘We are being—’ and that’s all."
> ‘我们被——’仅此而已。”

"What do you make of it?"
> “你怎么看？”

"Only an inch above the floor—it was written by someone lying on the ground, already on the verge of death.
> “离地面只有一英尺，可怜的家伙躺在地上写的，当时已经奄奄一息了，

They must have lost consciousness before finishing."
> 还没写完就失去了知觉。”

"They were trying to write: ‘We are being killed.’"
> “他想写：‘我们被杀。’”

"That’s my interpretation.
> “我是这么理解的。

If you find an indelible pencil on the bodies..."
> 如果在尸体身上找到防擦拭铅笔……”

"Don’t worry, we’ll look for it.
> “放心吧，我们会找的。

What about the securities?
> 证券是怎么回事？

There was no actual theft, but he did have those securities—we’ve verified that."
> 根本不存在什么盗窃，但他确实有那些证券，我们核查过了。”

"He must have hidden them somewhere safe, planning to ‘discover’ them later.
> “肯定被他藏到了安全的地方，

Once the elopement fades into history, he’ll suddenly produce them, claiming the guilty pair had a pang of conscience and returned the stolen items.
> 等私奔的事成为历史，他会突然拿出来，说是罪恶的一对良心发现，把赃物寄还回来，

Or he might say they were lost on the way."
> 或者说是掉在半路上了。”

"It seems you’ve solved all the mysteries," said the detective.
> “看来你解决了所有难题。”警探说，

"I can understand why he reported the crime—it makes sense—but why did he come to you? That part I don’t get."
> “他来报警倒也情有可原，可是为什么去找你，我实在想不通。”

"Pure arrogance!" Holmes replied.
> “纯属卖弄！”福尔摩斯回答，

"He thought he was clever and confident no one could outwit him.
> “他觉得自己聪明，信心十足，以为没人能超越他。

If the neighbors grew suspicious, he could always say, ‘Look, I tried everything—I didn’t just go to the police; I even consulted Sherlock Holmes.’"
> 万一邻居起疑心，他可以反驳：‘看哪，我可是什么法子都试过了，不只找了警察，甚至找了夏洛克·福尔摩斯。’”

The detective burst out laughing.
> 警探大笑起来。

"We must forgive you that ‘even,’ Mr. Holmes," he said.
> “我们必须原谅你这个‘甚至’，福尔摩斯先生，”他说，

"I’ve never seen a case handled so brilliantly."
> “我从没见过哪个案子办得这么漂亮。”

Two days later, my friend tossed me a copy of the *North Surrey Observer* biweekly, which bore a long string of headlines.
> 两天后，我朋友扔给我一份《北萨里观察家》双周刊，上面印着一长串醒目的标题，

It began with "Tragedy at The Haven" and ended with "Police Successfully Solve the Case."
> 以“避风港惨案”开头，“警方成功侦破”结尾。

The article beneath provided a detailed account of the entire affair, revealed publicly for the first time.
> 标题下一篇密密麻麻的报道，首次公开了事件的全部经过。

The final paragraph, highly summarizing, read as follows:
> 最后一段极具概括性，内容如下：

"Detective MacKinnon, with exceptional insight, deduced that the smell of paint was used to mask another odor, such as gas.
> “麦金农警探机智过人，推断出油漆味可能是用来掩盖其他气味，比如煤气，

He further speculated that the strongroom was the location of the crime.
> 并进一步大胆推测，保险库就是行凶地；

Subsequent searches uncovered an abandoned well, cleverly concealed beneath a dog kennel, where the bodies were found.
> 随后在搜查中发现一口废弃水井，外部用狗窝巧妙遮挡，尸体便藏在井中。

This case highlights the brilliance of official detectives and will be remembered in the annals of crime-solving history."
> 此案充分彰显了官方侦探的睿智，将永载罪案史册。”

"Well, well, MacKinnon isn’t half bad," Holmes said with a magnanimous smile.
> “好吧，好吧，麦金农这家伙也不赖。”福尔摩斯大度地笑道，

"Watson, you may record this case in our own annals.
> “华生，你可以把这案子记入我们自己的史册。

One day, the full truth will come to light."
> 总有一天会真相大白。”
